This has led some people to say we should have a suburban-type mall in the CBD. This would, however, make the CBD just another suburb and the city would then have no heart.

The reasons are obvious and, in our experience, are hugely successful. I am not talking about centres like Christchurch's South City or Auckland's Westfield, but something larger and more up-market. These centres are always anchored by one or two major department stores and contain numerous up-market specialty stores. They always have a large food court and sometimes cinemas. I think that Christchurch's need for such a centre is great. We lived in Toronto. While we were there they demolished an entire city block and built the Eaton Centre, which is a wonderful concept and is now the retail heart of the city. When we visited Toronto again last year, we found that the Eaton Centre was absolutely packed with shoppers all the time.

Rather than rebuilding the many denominational churches that have been destroyed, including the Anglican cathedral, we need to envision a beautiful facility that is not just inter-denominational but inter-faith, a place where people of many different faiths, or no faith at all, can gather to reflect on the mystery of life and reconnect with whatever it is that gives meaning to their lives. The reality is that we are living in a secular, post-Christian age. To have an Anglican cathedral at the heart of the city may have made sense when the city was originally designed in the mid-19th century, but it most assuredly does not make sense today. As we move more and more to become a global community, let's dare to dream of what is relevant for our own time.",6e4d001c43629dc111472177851d69e0d61006107aee18cdca2b25631463480e

1303,We should encourage the CBD to open later and stay open later as most European cities do. I believe our CBD should open at 10.00 or 11.00 am and stay open till 8.00 pm. Our CBD needs to set itself up as something different from the suburban offering. Office and other workers in the suburbs who finish work at 5.30 or 6.00 pm have little chance of any CBD retail experience. If the City opened later and stayed open till 8.00 pm then we would find workers come to town in the evening as a family to do retail shopping and then stay on for a meal or to catch up with friends in the evening. The city would create its own evening character and life like we see overseas.,332ab8a98620d0ca1c7cc9954b3d40d1d108aef0bc03d69d18f83eece6bac1df
