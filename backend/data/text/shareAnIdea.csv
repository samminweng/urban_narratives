"Thousands living in the central city in a wide range of housing. Especially highrise. LA, Taipei, Kobe-they're not afraid of tall bldgs"
"I believe that the city centre (CBD) should be of high density with medium rise building of 7, 8 and 9 stories high."
New buildings of 3-4 floors will help keep people in the centre. High pop. density brings life to cities and creates economic viability.
"want high density housing, with low footprint technologies surrounded by green / social / community space and linked to local business"
a medium-density thriving creative centre attracting talent and new residents from around the country and the world
Encourage more high density central city residential living
Take note of places like central Barcelona; low-rise high density living with inviting social / commercial spaces at ground level.
I don't want lots of apartments cheaply built and crammed in with no trees or open space around them. We don't want any more wall to wall concrete. We don't want cheap and nasty infill anywhere which will become ghettos in the future.
"Great central city apartment living. Low-rise, shared courtyards, no ugly battery hen developments. Quality and affordability"
"I want family and small child friendly spaces. Maybe high density living with purpose built childcare facilities for working families, safe walkways to and fro. Somehow incentives large companies to be based in the same areas to increase workers potential for work life balance with their families"
More mixed use-retail / commercial / residential with some cultural facilities nearby. To bring vibrant mix into rundown / empty areas of CBD
"Mixed use spaces, dispersed with green spaces and the arts & creativity sectors at the heart of the city, not just a precinct, but throughout the city!"
"All blocks / neighbourhoods should contain a vibrant mix of residential, retail, commercial, cultural, entertainment & hospitality spaces."
"Mixed use with residential, entertainment, retail + services, green spaces + seating."
"Open with a mix of retail areas, commercial, business & public parks"
"mixed spaces, office, shopping and living in one area."
"I want to see a mix of quiet spaces, memorial parks etc, grass spaces to sit and ponder and faster pace areas with night markets, late coffee shops, market space that would take up a whole block and be open everyday, including flower market, fruit and vegies, crafts, old bookshops, shops to wander in and practical shops. Low level buildings with a mix retail, office and living to gather. School and preschools close by."
"Multi-use buildings-retail, restaurants etc at ground level, residential, office space and niche stores above"
"More residential apartments interspersed with business, culture, and entertainment, Keep the centre alive 24/7."
"Mixed use buildings! Retail, offices and apartments so the space is activated 24/7 leading to a safe and vibrant city."
"A mixture of living, shopping and entertainment, make the central city vibrant and alive 24 hours a day, must be safe."
"Mix of homes business and entertainment. Open air entertainment area, so that people are more likely to live there and the place isn't an after dark ghetto."
"I want mixed use spaces, weekday weekend & night use safe & well lit"
Apartments above shopping areas to encourage people into the city.
"Vibrant city combining housing, tourism, entertainment, commerce with retail markets and green spaces"
"I want a mix of retail office and living space, apartment inner city living so the city is vibrant at all hours. a safe environment"
"a vibrant business area with supporting restaurants and cafes, a variety of shops."
"I would like the central city to be a mixture of green spaces (where buildings have come down or been demolished) shops, providing essential goods and services (but no cluster of take away / fast food outlets) and apartment buildings."
"We will know we have made the central city a great place because people will be back in it working, shopping, dining, enjoying a night out etc"
"Mixed use – business, retail, hospitality, entertainment plus low rise residential – to achieve vibrant, safe spaces that people want to be in."
"A mixture of retail, residential, arts, and commercial, lots of green space, green cycle belts connecting east west and north south."
"Mix of businesses, residences, small parks, shops, cafes, gardens."
"Encourage a mix of education, business, residential, green spaces."
"Think retail ground floor, office space 1st floor and living space 2nd floor, with a garden roof!"
"Apartments above shops and restaurants, with roof-top gardens and courtyards"
"City squares similar to European cities with shops, cafes etc.. Second and third floors of these buildings could be used for offices or apartments."
The European style of retail underneath two or three floors of apartment accommodation surrounding central and grassed squares.
"where whole blocks are cleared, consider creating 3 storey blocks with an inner square as in Barcelona, Spain. The buildings are used for shops on the outer street level and restaurants / bars in the inner sheltered square, which is paved, treed, artworks / sculptures etc.. On the second / third levels are business and accommodation."
"cafes shops, on bottom level, apartment living on level two up, or commercial space."
light and airy spaces around shops and buildings
"Eco friendly / sustainable buildings of imaginative design, plenty of light / space and greenery."
I want boutique shopping precincts to make for a distinctive shopping and living experience rather than the kind of experience that is a replica of any other shopping centre.
"Central city can't compete with malls so shouldn't try (stick to things that malls can't do, street markets, events, green spaces, entertainment and eateries)."
"No franchise shops in the retail spaces in the city, keep them in the malls."
"Small low rise, walker friendly central city with special boutique shops"
Retail space needs to be pedestrianised
Lots of pedestrian only mall areas paved with recycled bricks
less traffic more pedestrian mall type areas
"I want pedestrian mall areas, like Cashel or New Regent street"
"Lots of pedestrian mall areas, few cars, a variety of cafes, bookstores, and lots of green spaces."
"Make the CBD a pedestrian mall only, open areas, trams and no cars."
"Shared use space, like Cashel Mall was-pedestrians"
covered outdoor areas
covered lanes linking retail shopping areas to create a village atmosphere.
Cashel mall & ajoining areas with retrctable roof tht cover the whole st for bad wthr
Cheap covered walkway to the central retail area.
"Covering in cashel mall with clear roofing so light can will come in, gives the city a covered shopping area but different from mall."
"a covered area that can be used for a market or meeting place, good access and pedestrian friendly"
"don't want Timezone arcades, $2 shops (not a positive image for a new vibrant CBD, malls are a better place for them)"
"I want my old places back! Dux De Lux, Arts and crafts, concert venues, Smiths bookshop."
"I've missed the arts centre weekend market. Great eateries like the Dux de Lux, the restaurants along the strip etc.. And the nightlife, clubbing and bars are important for young people as we need to have a way to relax after studying and celebrate events. SOL Square was one of the best places in Christchurch."
The Arts Centre was a regular haunt – I miss that – and especially the Dux.
"Cafes / restaurants. Markets with artisan products. Unique shops that were at the Arts Centre. Brew pubs – Twisted Hop / Dux de Lux, small speciality shops, Toi Toi for example. City library. Events – lantern festival"
I have missed shopping at Ballantynes and a small craft shop under the car park.
"I have missed running / walking along the river through town, missed going to the central library, sitting in Cathedral Square, wandering around the shops and sitting at a café for lunch / coffee."
"Ballantynes, Dux, the lanes, cafes, arts centre, galleries, library. I used to have language school students I would bring in to the city. Miss have a day out, meeting friends, browsing, eating, ending up choosing an armload of books and music, or taking home goodies from the market."
"The Shuttle taking people around through town; the Central library; access to independent theatres – Metro, Academy; Arts Centre and the market; Christchurch Art Gallery exhibitors and talks; Dux de Lux; Museums; Robert McDougall Gallery; shopping at Ballantynes; inner city restaurants. The freedom to walk around the inner city."
"Ensure that redevelopment doesn't exclude or make unaffordable space for small business who bring vibrance, variety & character to the city"
small shop spaces for small start up shops to trial their concept. Use some of the council owned land. Incremental increase in rent until able to move to a private commercial space
"Create more retail space, lower average rent means higher number of boutique stores and coffee shops all equals a more interesting inner city."
I want small business spaces at affordable rental
Places for small businesses where rent is not too high
Rent needs to be subsidised in some areas to attract up and coming designers and entrepreneurs who need cheap rent to get started.
"Before the earthquakes the central city was looking very run down, somewhat like a third-world town, and was not well patronised. It had lost its role as the heart of the city. By contrast the suburban malls were always buzzing, so one wonders what the difference was. The malls attracted people because they were clean, it was easy to park, you were sheltered from the elements, you could do most of your shopping there, they had good coffee shops and good food was available. This has led some people to say we should have a suburban-type mall in the CBD. This would, however, make the CBD just another suburb and the city would then have no heart. However, if we could make some use of the things that make malls attractive, without building a mall, people would come back."
"Don't want no big shopping centres in centre town, go to suburbs for that kind of experience"
Malls are horrible places.
"I don't want big multi national owned mall that gives the city a bland as per all the other malls feel need eclectic, creative small enterprise in the central city"
Big flash mall with all the top shops of the world. Create one big shopping mall in central city around Ballantynes with good parking and fantastic cafes and eateries.
"Sheltered outdoor malls, strategic parking areas / buildings so people travel on foot / bike."
"Massive shopping mall in CBD, like Eaton Centre in Toronto or MBK in Bangkok, people love malls, let them have one downtown, they draw people in."
"We have noticed that there is a trend towards building large indoor shopping centres in city centres. and these centres form the nucleus of the city's retail shopping. The reasons are obvious and, in our experience, are hugely successful. I am not talking about centres like Christchurch's South City or Auckland's Westfield, but something larger and more up-market. These centres are always anchored by one or two major department stores and contain numerous up-market specialty stores. They always have a large food court and sometimes cinemas. I think that Christchurch's need for such a centre is great. We lived in Toronto. While we were there they demolished an entire city block and built the Eaton Centre, which is a wonderful concept and is now the retail heart of the city. When we visited Toronto again last year, we found that the Eaton Centre was absolutely packed with shoppers all the time. The centre is entirely enclosed and has a huge arched glass roof that lets in plenty of natural light."
"People go to malls, have biggest and best mall close to the CBD with ice skating, movies etc then lead off to the nice boutique shops, cafes, Ballantynes. green spaces."
Cohesive opening hours for CBD businesses. Actual late night shopping on Thurs / Fri instead of a hodge-podge of open places.
a city centre that doesn't close at 5.30 pm.
A CBD retail area that is under management to regulate shopping hours
Huge central market place (24 hours) where people meet and shop etc
Wellington has incredible New World Metro supermarkets. which offer significantly better food options for office workers and city residents than anything I've seen elsewhere. Attract one of these to the CBD along with plenty of office space and you're on to something!
"Businesses, professions, retail, creative ventures, spaces for markets and arts and crafts, not sanitised and all the same, create variation."
"Access to small businesses – dentist, photo lab, optometrist, bike shops. These businesses need central city premises. Big business is often duplicated throughout the city in suburban offices and malls."
Space for diversity of small businesses.
Don't want central city dominated by souvenir shops for tourists
A centre that has 10 gift / New Zealand shops as a weird hub!
no large mass produced souvenir shops round the Square
"Replace the souvenir shops around the square with buildings of cultural interest (galleries, museums etc) and cafes."
"In the past few years its [ the central city ] been full of tacky market type stalls, souvenir shops."
Concentrate on low rise buildings with retail / cafe space on the ground floor and office / living space above
"I don't want banks, insurance, etc taking up street level shopping space."
Ground floor business in the square should engage people like cafes & restaurants rather than shut off ones like banks that make it look dead
"architecturally designed buildings, retail and cafes on the ground floor with apartment style living above. internal courtyards for sheltered inner city living with spaces that many residents can share."
"Stop banks and other dead institutions from hogging key public areas, eg the south side of The Square. Have cafes and restaurants instead."
The utilisation of ground floor space within buildings fronting the square is where bars and cafes should be. Encourage the ANZ and BNZ to vacant their ground floor tenancies. They are the wrong occupies of ground floor retail space in the square.
The ANZ and BNZ banks occupying the two northern sunny street corners in Cathedral Square with their painted out windows or fully drawn blinds need to be a non-complying activity or presence in such important spaces.
"Occupy every ground floor in The Square with bars, cafes and restaurants. Intermingle the odd owner occupied boutique shop."
"Ground floor activities in CBD should be retail and service, not blank commercial facades that became the norm in Cathedral Square."
"I want Cathedral Square that feels safe at any time of the day or night, cafes, restaurants, concert areas, less business offices on the ground floor, vibrancy"
"A place to be entertained with a vibrant feel-hotels, bars, cafes, restaurants, theatre, movies, green spaces-like leicester square, London"
Need a centre that is packed with people day and night. Bring outdoor cafe spaces to the square and very close residential development
"I would love to see more apartment living, green public spaces and to retain our cafe culture with cafes spilling out onto squares and courtyards like in European cities"
cafes and bars with outside spaces.
"outside cafes, beautiful sculptures, outside music and dancing areas, bands."
"Provide space, and encourage, cafes and restaurants to sprawl outdoors in summer."
Restaurants and cafes with open-air courtyards for al fresco dining.
many cafes with outdoor terraces in the central hub of the city.
Lots of sheltered sunny outdoor areas outside cafe's and shops protected from the easterly wind where people can meet and sit
Cafes should be located on the south (sunny) sides of spaces and the CBD needs plenty of trees to mitigate against the killer easterly wind.
Don't have bars in the very centre of the city that are open to 5 am. Either limit the opening hours or put them somewhere else
"I personally in favour of more Bars and Restaurants in the central and fine dining places in the CBD. But, rather than giving permits / consents for bars & restaurants like issuing raffle tickets, the council should come up with a programme for theme bars & restaurants."
"have a real city mall, free parking, good shops, art cinemas, food cts, mall-wide vouchers, warm enclosed space."
Create an area for cinemas.
a multiplex of cinema complete in the square
"Art house cinema – really missing the Art Centre, Academy and Cloisters movie theatres."
Bring cinemas back to the square and create a venue there for the Court Theatre
"I remember as a child how I used to love going to the square. All the movie theatres were around it, you could go for a late supper, there were lunch time concerts, it was a dynamic, exciting place to be."
Central city alternative movie theatres showing something other than Hollywood tripe.
"Nightlife! Performing Arts, plays, theatre, spaces for quirky arty cafes where conversations can be had over world class coffee & candles"
night life with safe places to wander.
We need to have a bright night life without dark areas where low life can congregate.
"I also think having an area in which nightlife can be available for the people who want it, such as clubs and bars, but isn't in such a place that affects the people who are in the city for meals or shows. Then a nightlife zone with the clubs and bars."
"Revitalise the square to have more of a European flare, engineer space to deal with the wind then have stalls, coffee places, art, cafes."
surround the square with cafes and restaurants.
"cafes around cathedral, retail & offices on 2nd floor with apartment living above. Green up square"
Grass & gardens in the square with cafes around the perimeter.The square should be a beautiful hub of activity.
Bring green areas back to The Square and have cafes etc around it not banks.
Make the Square the heart / soul of the city by zoning out banks / offices on ground floors and encouraging more cafes and cultural events.
Enliven cashel mall. Ballantynes plus a 3? storey comprehensive shopping area as in many cities plus outdoor cafes etc
Small busy back alleys like Sol Square and Poplar Lane.
"Combination of alleyways (eg Poplar Lane) of bars / restaurants, w open green spaces. Street dining."
well thought out areas like SOL square and The Lanes '
Courtyards as part of building developments
lots of courtyards.
"inner courtyards bounded by buildings, think Berlin's hofs & contemporary versions of the Arts Centre's inner courtyards."
"Low-rise, shared courtyards."
I like the courtyard philosophy.
green apartments with rooftop gardens and lush courtyards.
I would like to see more intimate courtyards with cafes and water features.
"To facilitate the required fluid connectivity between the indoor and outdoor spaces, courtyards, covered terraces, cloisters and meandering pathways linking sprawling gardens, both functional and decorative, to built up areas, would be widely used."
The Integration of courtyards & gardens In & around buildings.
"Rebuild without high rise buildings around an inner courtyard for a mix of retail, residential, and commercial tenants."
Maybe courtyard style like the arts centre.
"Would like to see buildings with green space, say a central courtyard for staff facilities, atrium style"
Increase communal green space in the inner city with a range of courtyard parks and gardens
"High density developments could cluster buildings around pedestrian green space forming the core of a block, with ground floor retail activity facing the courtyard and the street, and apartments and offices above."
Low rise buildings surrounding a courtyard.
eating places not fast food outlets please!!
"Please don't have all the fast-food places altogether. Colombo St was noisy, dirty and felt unsafe late at night. The centre is for everyone, not just the teenagers (who used to hang outside these places!)"
"An area of the inner city rebuilt or designated as a China Town, with yummy restaurants, shops, celebrating chch's ethnic diversity."
A multi-ethnic area modelled on a China
Make a market / chinatown area
Ethnic themed areas
an ethnic food court place
more outdoor eating ethnic areas grouped
"Encourage ethnic areas, they add so much life to cities."
outdoor eating ethnic areas grouped.
ethnic market spaces.
More ethnic food places from all round the world
"banks etc at street level kill the central city, put them up on a floor."
Don't allow banks to occupy large ground level space.
"Avoid big bank and insurance outlets at ground level in the prime retail areas, especially the square"
There's less need these days for offices and the like to be in the centre
"huge head offices of insurance companies, insurance companies, etc, why do government departments have to be in the central city the same amount of inaccessibility as before the EQ, especially to govt departments, etc"
"head offices don't have to be in the central city eg insurance companies, solicitors, government"
"Government centred on Wellington puts the whole country at risk economically as if Wellington CBD was shut down like Christchurch is for the best part of a year New Zealand would have substantial governance problems. We need to lobby government to get some of its departments to relocate to Christchurch into new earthquake proof buildings that would provide a spread of risk for government and help Christchurch's rebuild. The Christchurch City Council also has offices and services spread all over the city. Our council as a major employer, should be looking to move as much as is sensible back into the CBD to assist with its rebirth."
"Keep insurance companies, banks and large corporations out of the central city and allow small businesses in."
I want diverse businesses instead of just banking institutions or lawyers. no large franchises keeping the large businesses slightly separated to the boutique area such as seen in Sydney
The point of a city is a business centre
"Low rise wooden buildings that have a WOW factor and are sustainable. Less business orientated and more a part of the university, local community and local shops. A place to meet people."
"Create the future : quake-safe, max 3-storey, energy efficient, colourful places to live, work and play, that sit well on the Pacific's edge."
"Have schools and beautiful residential areas within the city, a stronger community feel across all ages, not just for businesses."
"A central city is too important, to live only at designated hours; it must have offers at every hour of the day. It must have more than retail area. It must serve its citizens better."
"I would like to see part of Canterbury University come in town. Maybe the Arts and film dept, Having once been in central city at the Art centre. It would bring people (students) into the central city making it more vibrant and also good for biz."
"I want the University, or as a minimum try to encourage some departments back into the central city. You talk about key tenants, well this is the biggest and the best key tenant to have in the city."
bringing part of the university back into town (the arts) this will bring young people into the centre of the city which is needed to be a interesting and vibrant place getting people back to live in town.
"University and Polytechnic bought into the city, it would bring more life to the city centre."
The university would be in the centre city to add to the vibrancy.
The University should not be moved to the city centre for financial and logistical reasons (plus they don't want to move!)
Don't transfer the University back into central city.
"Leave the university at Ilam, it caters for a select group of people who may also come to the city centre for relaxing without the campus dominating the CBD."
Bringing the University to town? NO! the area would be a ghost town in summer and during winter breaks and students would not have the disposable income to support businesses there.
More educational activities in the centre of the city – young people add vibrancy.
Our central city will be school friendly. Kids in the city now will bring adults in future.
"I don't want schools, my experience of these is that the students take up public spaces as their own making the public feel unwelcome and intimidated"
"I don't want schools, as this encouraged groups of kids to hang around areas in large groups."
"No schools in central city, causes traffic problems."
"No schools, kids need space to run around not city shops."
21st Century library spaces. Quiet wireless internet working space.
Please make the Central city library as vibrant as the community libraries
"The central library – an excellent place to relax, read and use the computers."
More accessible and attractive central library. Old one was difficult to park at and looked scruffy.
"enlarge library, music centre in Farmers buildings."
The central public library in Gloucester Street needs to be transformed into the 21st century with a café and still strengthened against future earthquakes.
"Rebuild a light, airy central library with both quiet, secluded places and social areas, indoors and outdoors."
The power of a central library to bring people into the Central City should not be underestimated.
How about a central library for kids connected to the main library by a great cafe and play / reading area!
Develop a multi-denominational church / worship facilities in the central city
A multi-denominational church in Cathedral Square rather than just Anglican-so many faiths have lost their city base.
"a large church or cathedral for large worship gatherings and as central focus, doesn't have to be Anglican but should be Christian"
"The BIG question is what could best represent the spiritual heart of a cosmopolitan and secular city. Rather than rebuilding the many denominational churches that have been destroyed, including the Anglican cathedral, we need to envision a beautiful facility that is not just inter-denominational but inter-faith, a place where people of many different faiths, or no faith at all, can gather to reflect on the mystery of life and reconnect with whatever it is that gives meaning to their lives. The reality is that we are living in a secular, post-Christian age. To have an Anglican cathedral at the heart of the city may have made sense when the city was originally designed in the mid-19th century, but it most assuredly does not make sense today. As we move more and more to become a global community, let's dare to dream of what is relevant for our own time."
Perhaps an ecumenical church or sacred space where all denominations or spiritual practitioners could meet
A large scale rec centre for a large CBD residential population where we can do classes as well as swim and go to the gym.
A number of the other sports grounds on venues are damaged in Christchurch. We should be looking to bring these into the central city close to AMI Stadium. A task force of sports bodies should be set up to investigate this for the long term of these sports and the city. A look at Melbourne shows what having sports grounds and venues in the heart of the city has done for Melbourne.
"I have only been into town a few times since we moved back two years ago. The main reason being I have small children and town is no longer easy or safe for young children. I have to keep hold of the children on the footpath, there are no public toilets and no playground for when they get bored of shops, these things are what makes the malls attractive. If you want the central city to become a vibrant healthy place then you need to provide facilities for all including families and old people. To me this means safe walkways linking shops, open spaces, play areas and public facilities like parking and toilets."
"Make the CBD an easy place for all to access for shopping and recreation, effective public transport, accessible linkages between spaces and places Low rise for safety. Accommodation (of good quality, well insulated, double glazed) – To give city life, will access safely and security. Incentives for this."
Lots of green spaces and restaurants / bars and low level hotels. Close some streets but make town accessible.
More green spaces intermixed with hotel & back packer rooms.
"Rebuild hotels in form like Chateau on Park with green spaces, not high rise."
Up-market luxury hotels Up-market golf courses including a links course by the coast Green spaces Tree-lined avenues Tasteful places with good food where you can sit & eat / drink inside and out. People – in the winter as well as the summer!
Hotels no more than 4 floors set in nice grounds with trees and gardens – a park like setting.
Create tourism by creating a fabulous advanced city for tourists to view. Hotels around avon river precinct. Extensive use of weatherboards in rebuild like whistler in Canada. Gardens everywhere like Victoria square. Less concrete paving in the square.
"It will be appropriate for the centre to have a fairly generous amount and variety of tourist accommodation-hotels, bed & breakfasts ', and youth hostels."
"Tour buses parked under hotels, keep off the streets for drop off and load up."
Hotels could be higher rise than other general buildings in central city
Industrial business don't belong in the central city because they lack interaction with the public and with their environment.
"Awful use of city space, one story, dreary buildings with no character that are unwelcome to public."
"I don't want factories and manufacturing businesses, these can be moved to industrial areas"
Relocate the industrial businesses near Fitzgerald Ave and replace with a new inner city suburb for people living in quake-damaged areas.
I also think industry should be removed from the CBD to make way for more residential land and to eliminate unsafe or scary areas in the city
Industrial businesses distract from a vibrant city culture. Build industrial business parks out of the CBD and away from residential housing
"Central city should be for people and entertainment businesses. Heavy trucks, machinery, plain buildings can be grouped in industrial parks."
Often the outward appearance of the buildings and outside space is ugly.
would prefer more industrial parks located in appropriate areas than in the city centre
"The central city is no place for industrial businesses. Car dealers, panel beaters, warehouses etc require heavy transport to operate."
I don't want secluded areas for industry. this leads to block off areas that has potential for wrongful activity during the night
move the more industrial uses to dedicated areas outside the CBD. Or severely limit their dispersal in the CBD.
Industrial areas are dead zones @ night & therefore inefficient use of space in the inner city.
"Not active areas 24/7, 365 – dark and scary at night, dead during weekends."
"Don't like big buildings, not safe for people to be around at night, better in industrial parks."
"Not good as empty at night so magnet for taggers, drinkers etc making unsafe feeling area. Unsightly."
"High tech, high-value light manufacturing should definitely have a place within a wider central city"
We need ethnic areas. Most major cities around the world have a China town or a Little Italy. With food choices within these areas. Would be fun to shop in!
"Arts, cultural centres with dedicated theatre e.g. Court, boutique specialty shopping, dining, inviting place for locals, tourists."
"I want different zones for different activities eg. cultural things centred around the art centre, business around Hereford st / colombo st and university in the old turners & growers site"
"Firstly a substantial arts hub based around the Town Hall Auditorium, the Art Gallery and the Arts Centre. This area could be developed with cafes, and arts studios"
"Precincts! I'd love to see more of the areas that have already been special to Chch, Arts Centre, High Street, within our four aves."
"different precincts within cbd eg asian or chinatown, shopping area, café and dining area, outdoor and events space, nightlife area, arts, museum, garden, all serviced by bikes and trams, all focussed on sustainable practices"
"Bar and restaurant precincts similar to Sol Square, Poplar Lane and the Strip."
"Chinatown. Every great city has one, the city centre is big enough and needs different district. Another sol square and popular lane with a china town feel would be brilliant."
ethnic restaurants grouped in an area.
"An entertainment precinct with Luna Park, icerink, bowls, video computer games, Theatres and various small performance venues, separate from bars and alcohol venues."
"Recreate historical precinct, i.e. colonial style, safe wooden cottages near river for couples or retired people."
A substantial area must be set aside to establish a precinct dedicated to the reintroduction of this iconic Christchurch building design
"use the turners and growers site for a multipurpose stadium, pool, carpark and shopping precinct to attract people into centre and support city centre users"
"Precincts like sol square, poplar lane, high street"
"Keep the ‘ precincts of CHCH alive ', they really add variety to the city and make it feel like it's grown up enough to have it's own character e.g. High St fashion, Litchfield Lanes, the Strip, the Arts Centre."
"I want more areas like high st, and the lanes like SOL"
Precincts with different atmospheres or themes e.g. New Regent Street with the eateries and SOL Square with bars
Sometimes enclosed space is fun eg Poplar Lane – gives a more intimate feel. It's interesting to explore alleyways etc especially if there are interesting shops.
"Poplar Lane, Sol Square, The Strip were the most innovative ideas, they drew people into those areas even though they were tucked away."
"So what do I want to see in my new central city? I want to know which carpark or bus hub to use as my base if I want to buy a man's suit, or a lounge suite, or a diamond ring, or a book, or whatever. Once there, I expect to find all the best and most interesting specialist purveyors of such merchandise, all close by for easy comparison and consideration and competing to outdo one another."
"Better pedestrian connectivity between areas. Wide pedestrian walkways connecting, river, parks and shops etc.."
"green space in cathedral square, open walking and cycling routes through city joining business and leisure precincts"
Free trams or mini buses for moving around central precincts.
"When rebuilding CBD have green areas, connecting precincts together, offering light and space, as you walk from area to area."
A series of canals (we have a high water table). Linking commercial / retail precincts and connected to the Avon River and its punting tourist attraction. Pathways and cycle ways would add to this attraction
"no adult shops anywhere near family areas. Knocking shops etc should have their own precinct, not be sprinkled everywhere. No explicit advertising billboards either."
"Shift the red light area from Manchester street and contain it within a smaller, safe precinct. Prohibit sex industry outside that area."
keep to area zones eg boutique shops in one area market in another and sex shops brothels etc in there own designated zone.
"As a garden city we need to walk the walk of providing community garden spaces, allotments for various housing developments, and even educational working gardens for kids and adults to be taught gardening skills."
Empty spaces between buildings filled with trees. This will make Christchurch more of the Garden City. I want Christchurch to be seen as a leading city in terms of its emphasis on sustainability and communities.
"World leading green spaces, from a technology point of view and also literally, trees and plants"
"I want green spaces and the most made out of the river, board walks etc.. Something unique that you can't find anywhere else in the world, something that we can be proud of and that people will want to come and see. A local economy that needs to be in the centre, businesses that bring people to the city."
"I want office space built to green sustainable codes of practice. All new buildings to have high green specifications. Be a world leader in green, sustainable commercial buildings."
I want public space for all ages to enjoy. Entertainment centres within the city to encourage a more community based culture. Keep it green and sustainable. We call ourselves a clean green nation but we are behind much of the world in this. A place that creates international interest for innovation and sustainability.
"I would like the empty sites left from demolished buildings to be made use of in the short term, as it may be many years before building starts on them again. These empty spaces can be utilised as mini parks where upon grows grass, flowers & small trees"
"I want plenty of park space. Places for kids, teens, mums and dads. Where things aren't anymore we could have wonderful art painted walls surrounding small parks, a preschool play area, another, for musicians to come and play and other for mime artists etc etc. lots of little event centres in our new spaces. This may not be a long term thing but a great way of making our new spaces fun and friendly until they get refilled with buildings. Maybe we will decide not to refill them all."
There needs to be a blend of business and recreational opportunities. Bringing sports facilities into the central city will not only support those who live and work there but also ensure that people will come into the city perhaps long before the commercial activity returns fully.

"Small secret hidden pocket gardens. Relaxing areas to eat, read, relax within the hum of the city. Good for elderly out for the day, workers having lunch and a break from work, young parents to take children to eat, youth to gather and talk"
The CBD needs more pocket parks that encourage people to linger and give kids a place to play. Shopping and touristing are more fun when there are lots of places to take a break.
Buy some empty sections for pocket park every few hundred meters.
Some of the newly vacant land should be acquired to form a network of pocket parks.
small park like areas.
Small lanes with small park spaces.
Give up rebuild on some CBD sections for small park (parkletts) to break up the buildings
plenty of varied-size parks with loads of flora / fauna
"a big park containing a few fountains, benches, seats, and of course a cathedral."
A big park because it's a way to be away from all the noise and pollution and just relax. Add gardens and stuff.
"I want a big park instead of one of the squares for children to play and have fun, eg.. Playground, hopscotch, outdoor pool."

"A sturdy wooden playground for the kids in the central city with green astroturf floor, trees, cafes around for Mum's & Dad's to connect & have coffee while the kids enjoy playing with each other."
"Somewhere in the centre also to have a covered-in playground, where parents can take their children all year regardless of weather, where a roof would protect them from rain, and coffee kiosks and park benches for the parents."
"Also have a place for children, a playground"
Green spaces celebrating native and introduced flora.
Green space areas reflecting native flora and European influences.
Open spaces with native greenery.
More native plantings in green areas

"Reclaim the Garden City brand, Rooftop gardens, tree lined streets, more parks."
More open Green Spaces and rooftop gardens.
"I want social spaces and seating so people can interact. Parks, rooftop gardens and lower buildings to stop the wind tunnelling"
I want a dog park so people can go into hagley without being bothered by dogs
"I'd like to see more apartment style living, but personally would like there to be facilities to enable dog ownership in such places. So, a number of dog exercise areas / dog parks spread around the city would be important."
Currently there are 3 dedicated fenced dog parks in the whole city but none close to the CBD. Because you live in the CBD does not mean you do not have a dog!!!!!
"Also a dog park or two would be great, one with obstacles and jumps etc"
a dog park or a place where you can go with your dog.
Have a dog park or 2 (other side of the road to the people / cyclists)
I want central dog park
I want dog park where they can run free.
"City squares similar to european cities with shops, cafes etc"
"Create intimate squares with shops, gathering spots and water."
Fountains. Small green squares for sitting.
fountains etc make the square beautiful
"more car free squares like in European cities, these are great for gathering and relaxing"
"The square actually becomes the centre point of the city in a similar way to a European piazza, lined with cafes, bars and restaurants."
"the square to be modelled more on a european city with cafes, pubs art and cultural themes. hanging baskets, trees, fountains etc make the square beautiful accessible and our own!"
"Make Cathedral Square into a grand piazza with limited vehicle intrusion, allow cafes around the edges and replace the ugly police kiosk with one that is user friendly."
Restaurants around the outside of Cathedral Square that have outdoor seating like European cities to bring diners in and create atmosphere.
I like the idea of mosaics and piazza's (like in Italy / Spain) a pleasant way to eat lunch and beautiful space to be in.
I think that there should be more attractions in Cathedral Square and there should be more grass and gardens.
Make square more colourful. grey paving is lifeless and colourless.
"Repave and redevelop the whole area over a period of time (10-15 years) using terra cotta paving stones (or similar colour tones) or brick to enhance the general appearance and to make the Square look less sombre, especially during the winter months."
"Replace the hard, grey Square with lawns and gardens (like Victoria Square), with plenty of perimeter seating, and open space for public gatherings"
"A green Cathedral Square, grass, trees, gardens, outdoor cafes sheltered from the wind. A place where people want to linger."
All my life the Square has been a cold depressing grey place. Please make it more welcoming when you redesign it
"Square around the cathedral needs to have lots of greenery, trees, seating to make it into a much more user friendly for people. Those ugly tiles should go!"
"The square needs to be a vibrant place full of restaurants and cafes, and why not have a big play area for kids somewhere in the centre for kids to play while you have a cuppa."
cafes around the square. More people the safer the square becomes.
"Before the earthquake the square was dull, cold, uninviting."
A green cathedral square with plants and trees and cathedral will be so much better.
"Put a kids playground just like the Botanic Gardens one (near the café) in the middle of Cathedral Square, get grass, kids, and a paddling pool into the heart of the city."
A state of the art playground in the square
A children s playground in the Square.
No blank banks or offices fronting onto cathedral square at ground level
Replace the BNZ / ANZ from the square
Less tourist shops in cathedral square
The ANZ and BNZ banks occupying the two northern sunny street corners in Cathedral Square with their painted out windows or fully drawn blinds need to be a non-complying activity or presence in such important spaces
"Keep the square for bigger gatherings, but also with more shops and cafe / bars."
"Square to be redeveloped devoid of commercial businesses, banks and the like to be a colourful space with optimum use made of sun drenched areas for cafes & such like, some greenery incorporated and the oppressive colour grey not featuring."
"Make Square more lively with Theatres, Restaurants and Cafes to make it the hub again."
Lack of ‘ heart to Christchurch – the Square as a focal point
The Square being the central focus
"Make the square a true centre like Federation square, Times square, so will need more than the cathedral, maybe one or two other iconic buildings or a large statue or fountain"
Cathedral square must be the axis of Christchurch and as so many people also feel needs to be the attraction and accommodation area for visitors
No cars in the square. ; Cathedral Square should have attractive lighting
"Make the square, people friendly with lots of grass walking areas and beautiful lights."
the road restored right around the square as before but not in front of the Cathedral
No traffic around the square
2 blocks in each direction of Cathedral Square as pedestrian only.
I would like hotels / accommodation to surround the square (not high rise buildings) there needs to be light.
"WANT Pedestrian only market squares composed of low-rise, stepped height, mixed use buildings. Let the sunlight in and control the wind with natural wind breaks."
No high rises to the north which block half the square's sunshine.
"Use of squares with central shared space, designed to minimise impact of colder winds."
no more tatty cheap depressing markets in Cathedral Square.
"No cathedral square market, it was ugly"
"we should not have a market in cathedral square that sells foreign goods, the square should be about christchurch, New Zealand and its people."
No market stalls in square selling made in China goods. Something far more classy!
"the square not just full of top notch businesses or tourist area business. Somewhere everyone feels safe, especially nighttime."
"Make the square safe, welcoming and people friendly"
"Cathedral square needs – mixed purpose buildings with cafes, nightlife, apartments, Should be somewhere people want to be at night"
A substantial area must be set aside to establish a precinct dedicated to the reintroduction of this iconic Christchurch building design.
Ice skating rink in winter in the Square.
Bring in an outdoor ice skating rink for the winter time in main square (like Quebec) to attract families in
I love the ice rink in the square in winter idea.
"Cathedral Square – market, ice skating."
Chalice should be moved to Cranmer Square.
Move the chalice out of the square
"Move the chalice from its present site in the square to somewhere more appropriate with it's artistic merit, art centre precinct"
"A sculpture to put in place of chalice. Please choose an idigenous Canterbury one from, e.g. the Waipara Iron Mongery forge, e.g. norwester, a matagown bush made out of iron. Very contemporary."
More spaces like SOL square with cool bars and shops
I loved SOL square and its quirkiness we need some more fun places for our young people!
SOL square was something people talked about.
Well thought out areas like SOL square and The Lanes
Lanes and spaces to explore (like Poplar Lane and Sol Square) with appropriate shop / cafes / bars.and little green areas.yeah.something like that :)
Another sol square and popular lane.
encourage establishing boutique shops / cafes / bars with the type of character that existed in Poplar Lane and Sol Square.
"Pockets of small intimate spaces and lanes (like SOL square and Poplar lanes) for meeting, eating and entertainment."
"More places like Victoria Square, more gardens."
More garden and green space like Victoria Square.
"More green areas like Victoria Square, more trees, grass etc.."
"Gardens – i.e. lawns, trees, flowers. Compare Victoria Square with Cathedral Square. One is pleasant, vibrant but Cathedral Square is open space, paved and dead."
"open squares, lots of trees and plantings. The Victoria Square is a great example. Please totally change Cathedral Square."
Make the Square user-friendly like Victoria Square. And have plants and more plants!
I also loved Victoria Square with its fountains.
Plenty of planters with flowers (more like Victoria Square).
use victoria square as a model for the size and scale of public areas and connect these green areas together using the river as a corridor
"A Square needs to be developed to match Cranmer, Victoria and Latimer squares just south of the central square."
I reckon we should have squares that are similar to Victoria Square because I'd like Christchurch to look a bit old English or medieval
More spaces like Victoria Square.
Cranmer and Latimer Squares are superb areas that could be better used. More public art
Cranmer and Latimer Squares a much under utilised in this respect – because nowhere to sit and eat / drink.
"I believe the Central City should utilize it's green spaces better, the appeal of Latimer Square and Cranmer Square are greatly reduced by the one way system. I 'm not advocating for the removal it but perhaps it could be altered to reduce the effect it has on pedestrian use in the city."
"Hold some open spaces, squares like latimer and cranmer are the making of the city."
"Make more of our parks, Latimer Sq and Cranmer Sq were wasted as open bits of green. Playgrounds, open air cafes, sculpture / water, flowers"
"Our green spaces – Latimer Square and Cranmer Square perhaps linked with a tree lined green Boulevard, with seats."
"Latimer and Cranmer Squares Redesign with flowers, shrubs etc for relaxing, area for ex-Art Centre stalls. Outdoor entertainment areas."
A big call but perhaps relocating and part-funding a bigger better music centre for everyone in one of the soon to be empty blocks around Cranmer square?
Use Cranmer and Latimer squares for markets.
Use large spaces like Latimer Square for markets.
"Create interesting spaces for people (Cranmer sq, Latimer Sq, Victoria sq)."
Cramner and Latimer Squares superb lets have more tree lined squares with residential facing onto them.
Renovate Latimer square too many. prostitute customers are squandering there
Markets add to the vibrancy of a central city
"More markets, they are so lively, colourful and inviting. They instantly make the city a better place to be."
Do what other cities do. Have a large night market with produce and goods from shops and private sellers and stay open on market night till late. Have it in the square on in cramner / latimer sq with buses and trams that can enable tourists and Christchuch folks to get there easily.
Central market like Melbourne.
"A covered market area with delicatessens, fruit / meat, produce, clothing area etc.. Similar to Melbourne market. Tourist attraction and will bring locals into central city."
Combining Farmers and Craft / Tourist markets together to truly show off the regions artisans as well as having space for some of the larger companies to showcase products.
"farmer's market :, have bi-weekly or at least once a month a large, true farmer's market in or near the central city."
"Think Victoria Park Market. A fresh / organic market, vegetables, flowers, fish, cheeses, NZ wines and other produce."
Have a large permanent central city food market like other great cities and have a separate market for non food products That opens early 6-7 am so supplier can come in and sell their fresh local produce
ethnic market spaces
A Central City Marketplace would attract a diverse profile of people
"A dedicated market space that is purpose built for all types of produce, drink suppliers, niche producers etc.. It should be a space for both public and commercial buyers during all days of the week. Look at examples in Melbourne / San Francisco / New York. There should be space for Brew pubs as we have one of the largest and most active Microbrewery regions in Canterbury and we should promote this responsibly"
"A fantastic Central Market that is open all the time not just weekends drawing people in to the city. Focus on food and eating, but also selling art / craft, other. With spaces for entertainment, buskers, music, performances, circus, drama etc.. A place for people to gather and eat and enjoy the talents Christchurch has to offer."
It will have a central market place.
"Why not incorporate a huge indoor market into the Central City Rebuild, it could be architectually designed and be in a permanent attractive form to include a variety of outlets in various specialised sections e.g Fresh Food, Fish, Meat, Farmers / Organic Market, Clothing, Toys and Souvenirs etc.."
"cool market zones, like flower market, art market, antiques markets in different areas around the cbd to encourage walking to each zone"
Saturday and Sunday markets in the square.
"I am thinking of an outdoor food market, with tables and chairs on Cathedral Square."
"A re-make of Lower High Street, the environment that people were attracted to visiting there. Not the traditional buildings but buildings with charm and atmosphere. Plenty of cafes, designer boutiques and markets, something like the early art centre markets."
Lets reclaim Latimer and Cranmer squares for the public with cafes and outdoor stalls etc..
"Corners of these Parks could allow markets to be set up, other sites could be used by social agencies, community groups sharing and educating the public on their commitment to the people."
"I agree with the suggestion that we should develop an inner city (food) market, group the current specialist food shops-Verkerks, Vino Fino, the Cheese shop etc., around the currently empty land Madras / Lichfield and invite stallholders to set-up there too. Halfway between town workers and Polytech students and close to residential areas."
A pedestrian friendly central city. As fewer cars as possible.
Pedestrian friendly areas – cars not so dominant in the future city centre.
Attractive spaces that are friendly to pedestrians.
I want to see safe places for pedestrians. This means places where there are NO cars. I want to be able walk safely without worrying that a car will run me over. I want to be able to amble. I don't want to be controlled by traffic lights that appear to be there only to control me and to allow cars to dominate.
Full Pedestrian areas extended for a more liveable centre.
"Pedestrian friendly / priority – great pedestrian spaces, interesting paving made footpaths"
"people space, pedestrian activity, people meeting, lots of people cycling around."
People friendly catering for people from all walks of life. Less traffic. More pedestrian only areas. A vibrant fun city.
people engaged in diverse activities. It will be a great place to walk e.g. pedestrian walkways.
"Cycling :, create separate cycle lanes, NOT one that is shared with cars. Why : safer cycling for all age groups, especially children and the elderly, create cycling areas in the outskirts of the city specifically for those cyclists training for competitions, or just exercising. Why : reduces accident rates between cyclists / motorists by having them NOT using busy city routes for this"
"Lots of green spaces and cycleways, creating a network separate from the car / vehicle network."
lanes well away from parked cars (too many car doors knock cyclists off their bikes) and that cars can not drive in (e.g. berm to separate)
Cycle friendly roads. Areas even where cars don't go. Even more than we had before.
Be able to cycle safely in separate cycleways. Encourage others to bike by having drop off pickup easily identifiable city bikes that can be left anywhere within the CBD area. Lots of bike stands. We need to be planning for oil crisis and less reliance on cars. IF it were safe to cycle in central city I would come to the CBD far more often
if cyclists and pedestrians are to share space it will require the enforcement of the fitting and use of warning bells on cycles. Like many older people I can not hear a cycle (or a child's scooter or mobility scooter) coming up behind me on the footpath.
"Purchase land rights of demolished empty spaces to allow claiming of space to allow widening of roads, tree planting, cycle ways etc.."
"More space, wider roads, more access for cycles (separate two way cycle lanes)"
"More pedestrian friendly streets. Restricted areas cars can go down, wider streets for walking with friends and more cafes etc.."
"car-free inner city is a must, not just one little pedestrian area."
No car parks in the inner city on the street except disabled and drop-off parking.
"Banning cars from the CBD (or any other large area of Christchurch) is a non-starter. People value their mobility too much. What is needed is the separation of pedestrians, cyclists and motor vehicles. Separating cars and buses from pedestrians and cyclists is most easily achieved by dividing the CBD (and other parts of Christchurch) into precincts."
"A car-free centre and slowed traffic outside that core (30 km / h) supports walking and cycling and offers an inviting pace benefiting shops, restaurants and residents."
"Truly make it the garden city, create a linked corridor from Hagley park to the Sea with walkways / cycleways along rivers and streams."
"Following the guidelines Jan Gehl made for Christchurch in 2009 we want a more people friendly city centre, reducing the through traffic."
"Lots of people, trees, green spaces."
Large people only areas.
Centre point for people to gather.
Make the centre a people place.
people focused areas.
for a great Central City? People – bringing community together.
Spaces to meet and greet people.

More green areas with seating and some areas with shelter
plenty of green spaces and seating for people.
lots of places to sit and reflect.

"A green, attractive place to meet friends, socialise and shop. More street seating, public art, areas sheltered from the wind"
"Creation of public space to encourage real, face-to-face communication"
"I'd like to see more green spaces and tree-lined streets, more places to relax and avoid traffic noise"
connect. areas with green walks for people only and trams.
Places to sit not surrounded by concrete!
"More native plantings in green areas, lower maintenance and higher natural biodiversity than exotic species."
More green spaces / water features. Get rid of the trees and replace with evergreens.
I want more family areas playgrounds
I want more playgrounds because there has to be more in the centre
"centre point for people to gather, recreation markets, e.g. large games in square to get people to interact, talk, build, community."
"more big games e.g. chess, pedestrian areas, labyrinth in a green space"
"new buildings set back from sidewalks to allow space for gardens and trees, softens hard lines."
Any building on demolished sites to be set back from footpath boundary allowing for a sense of space.
wide streets and boulevards a café culture a place where people gather for business or pleasure
Low rise eco friendly buildings – set well back from the existing course of the Avon river.
"Sculptures that area a part of the buildings and social areas, rather than alone and free standing. Cohesion between all elements, with a common green and cultural theme"
"Green spaces, fountains and statues"
Lots of street art and spaces for the temporary!
"Carrying out regular footpath / street checks on new / existing paving tiles / cobbled areas eg : Cathedral square when re-opens, to ensure these areas are in good condition and clear of obstructions eg : broken glass for all foot traffic to utilize eg : Able-bodied, People with disabilities eg : Wheelchair users. Similar to the Kerb cut downs that there are on footpaths / streets throughout the city. The same [ could ] be applied to the raised kerb pieces in order to access the lawn areas in the botanic gardens. Kerb cuts could be made in various places along the raised kerb pieces that there are currently in order to access grassy areas throughout the Botanic Gardens, that people with disabilities eg : Wheelchair users to be able to get themselves up onto lawn areas, without having to wait until they came across a flat piece with NO raised lip in order to be able to access the grassy areas within the Botanic Gardens. From the perspective of a wheelchair user I think consulting, with various groups of people / organizations who experience certain difficulties within their daily life, perhaps due to having a disability, will be important in order for the New Christchurch to be as accessible and user-friendly as it can be to everyone"
Places to sit outside and be with people. Protection against the elements.
Weather conscious community spaces. Our Easterly winds are so miserable even when they have sunlight = Christchurch winters have been grey concrete cold. Windy – people suffer. We need visual treats so form and colour that is uplifting to move through in all seasons.
Lots of cover in outside space to allow for Christchurch's weather so you can be outside.
"Shaded covered areas, not the old heavy verandas but colourful awnings."
Cover large areas with a plastic light weight canopy for all weather protection
We could have glass domes over the areas for the winter and this would mean you could grow native palms.
"You could put a roof over the main areas – Cashel, High, Parts of Colombo (between Lichfield and Hereford) and make it a mall area."
Meeting places that are sheltered. There is not a pleasant place to walk or meet up that has a roof so its protected from weather rain and hot sun.
"green spaces, places to sit in and out of the sun or even if it's raining"
horrible dull grey square replaced with more green
Integrate buildings and open spaces. I like the courtyard philosophy
"more courtyards, fountains and sculptures"
Internal courtyards inside blocks.
water play area for families – a smaller version of Brisbane's Southbank
Please also have lots of lighting. I loved the way the bridges and trees along the Avon River were lit up
"keep lights un trees and light displays on bridges, buildings etc it gives our city a magical effect, place you want to be at night"
Well lit spaces encouraging people to come to the central city-day and night.
"Focus on boulevarding the central city – wide streets, lots of trees, street dining, fewer cars."
Colombo Street Boulevard – tram in the middle – great walking areas
"I'd like to be able to walk from the museum to High Street (Alice's and Polytech) along a bustling, vibrant boulevard of niche shops, cafes, green spaces, markets."
Restoration of Catholic Basilica and its environs to be linked to main centre by a boulevard and trees – make it stunning. Tree lined streets.
"Worcester Street should be widened to provide a wider and complete boulevard, properly lined with trees from the Square to the Museum."
Pedestrianised streets and green corridor linking ‘ piazzas green squares.
"more cycle lanes, more pedestrian areas"
"more pedestrian areas, cycle lanes"
well defined cycle lanes well away from parked cars
spaces linked via pedestrian and cycle ways.
lots of cycle parks dotted around the city
I want free bike usage for central city transport

I would like to see some development around the Avon River so that we can buy our coffee and sit by the river.
We need to celebrate the Avon River.
Making the most of the Avon river.
The Avon river is focal point.
"Highlight the River Avon, making it a pedestrian corridor, with a market area close by."
We need to be a lot more relaxed about using and beautifying this water way through the central city. Currently there is a no go attitude when looking at river bank enhancements that involve any sort of structure for public use. We need to be much more flexible and open minded with regard to better unitizing the Avon River banks. That we should aim to have a walk way the full length of both sides of the Avon River from the Hospital to Barbadoes Street. The Avon River is our prize jewel and we do not allow people to wander along it easily.
"Expand the lawn / garden area alongside the Avon, to include a walkway along the length of the river in the CBD & seats & areas for relaxation"
"boulevards along the river, wide pavements for walking ie Melbourne."
Use the river as a green corridor to move thru the city. Remove the roads beside it (like Melbourne or London South Bank).

Accentuate and connect out Avon river asset to the rest of the city. Close Oxford Street to traffic and make it green.
"Create a green zone along the banks of the Avon River by changing the designation of Cambridge and Oxford Terraces from open road to walkway / cycleway with vehicle access for service vehicles, electric shuttle buses or trams, and taxis at designated points along the route."
Get rid of the road next to the strip and allow use of whole area of river.

Small areas just to sit inside and outside along river. Wider bridges over the river including seats.
Use the Avon river all the way out to Brighton. Needs seating and even cafes and walking and cycle paths.
"Make the river the focal point with lots of seating, tables and greenery either side of it, as well as play areas for children."
"I want seating near the river for quiet, reflective times."
"Have restaurants and cafes next to the riverside, to create a safe but lovely area in the summer months."

"I want lighting, music, live entertainment around the river. Make it our heart like Melbourne / London."
"Open up original waterways, many little streams are boxed up under buildings and roads, bring them back and make them green spaces."
"I think Di Lucas idea of re finding the old waterways through central Christchurch, landscaping them into a feature of the council city, is a good one."
"Uncover the buried river tributaries and make them pretty. Do not rebuild on them, not safe."
Punting / Kayaking along the Avon River with options to stop for a sandwich and beverage along the way.
Walk along / canoe / or sit on a punt – the Avon. There is a focus along the river.
"Boating on the river, displays against the river backdrop, displays on the river, flowers."

"Make the Avon a focal point. Clear land on both sides of the Avon River. Have footpaths and cycle ways on both sides and foot bridges every so often. Have buskers, ice cream vendors, hot dog vendors, etc.."

"Have open spaces on every city block for people to have lunch, meet and hang out. water features, cafe style tables and some greenery."
"Gardens, seats and picnic areas"
"Great seating made with recycled material from the buildings, plaques could be placed in them with info about which building they came from"
"More places to take families too, e.g., parks, playgrounds"
move roads away from river edge
Plants : some areas might have native focus; but others should be predominantly European / English. Many deciduous trees for autumn colour.
Signs : Street names stylish and visible. House numbers large and placed so easy to spot. Business names discreet and tasteful.
"loudspeakers, bus / train announcements, museum / public places, any talks / microphone, ensure there's NZSL translation as well so it's fully accessible. Signage is important too. VISUAL would be great for ChCh."
"Visually creative space, not commercially dominated by billboards. A limit on advertising visual space."
"Signs point you to the river, (like the Thames in London) which is a cycleway, with sculptures, pubs etc.."
Signage in Hagley Park. Indicate where each path leads. I frequently meet confused tourists.
Name quarters or precincts in the central city
"As a long term resident of the central city I found it was frustrating to live in an area without a name. I propose that names are given to areas of the city encompassing 5 to 10 blocks, such as Victoria for the areas of one or two blocks adjacent to that street, The Bricks for the area around the present fire station, Boat Sheds or Museum for that area. Further suggestions for other areas are St Michaels, Latimer, St Marys, and Courts. SOL was already a welcome start. Giving titles will help define a neighbourhood and foster a sense of community."
"Better toilets especially in Square – hard to get to for women, needs to be easier to access"
toilets around the centre of the city.
more well signed toilets; toilets around the centre of the city.
More public toilets available across the CDB instead of just one at the square. [ this will make the city ] safe after dark
clean accessible public toilets and change tables (places like parent rooms)
High quality public rest rooms in prominent places are essential if you want people to be comfortable spending time in the central city.
We need to have park and ride systems on the fringe of the city with free shuttles into the central city.
"No through traffic (cars and buses) but have adequate safe / convenient and cheap parking areas surrounding city (e.g. 4 avenues) and good connection to CBD internal transport system (trams, cycleway, mini-metro e.g. Perugia, walkways. Would need to keep some routes open for delivery etc for commercial activities."
Carparking outside four avenues. Rapid transit into centre (no tourist tams) and within centre. Residents parking only in city centre.
Less cars with adequate car parking on the periphery of the central city.
Plenty of parking spaces on the periphery.
No more car parks near the centre of the city
"park and ride, patrolled safe parking areas on edge of city, cheap mini buses taking commuters in / out of city"
More first hour free in multi-story car parks. More free shuttle buses around central business district.
"Do not want to see cars and buses in the central city. Provide ample and easy parking around, good public transport to fringes of CBD, but reserve CBD for pedestrians, cafes and restaurants (with outside space) parks, Boutique shopping"
"Attractive Park 'n Rides at key points in suburbs. For this to encourage use of public transport, parking must be free and well lit, policed area, works overseas!"
Get rid of parking metres (why go to centre when malls free?
"Parking, parking, parking. Its the one thing suburban malls have over the central city (and its free)."
"Within the four Avenues, we could make all the two-way streets (and those few one-way side streets) into 30 km / h zones and eliminate all on-street parking. This cuts out the traffic within the city that just drives around looking for a park, it provides additional lanes on the one-way streets to carry the extra traffic diverted from the two-way streets, and it provides space for dozens of â € ˜living streets within the city. Of course, this will require a significant increase in off-street parking. Fortunately we have the empty sections, some of which can be asphalted over and start earning money for the land-owner right now, while parking buildings are constructed in others."
Have car parks located close to each of the four one-way streets. Have lots of public cycle stations on each of the four one-way streets. Inside the four one-way streets make car parking really expensive.
"I don't want streets taken up with parked cars, large buses blocking streets and carrying only a few people"
I don't want streets with cars parked all along the sides.
Create car parking opportunities off street – integrated into the rebuild so that wide footpaths and attractive space can be created outside retail and create active frontages.
fewer car parking spaces on roadside
Don't want. car parks taking potential green spaces.
"Locate car parking buildings on the one-way system rather than within the CBD, to encourage cars to stay outside the central area."
on empty sites there should be no temporary car parks but compulsory green space until consent for new buildings is granted.
I hope the empty lots in the central city aren't turned into car parks.
"Malls, shops disabled accessed. Disabled car parks."
Is underground car parking possible to avoid ugly car parks?
dedicated motorcycle parking spaces
This is already increasing so I would like to see more parks for motorbikes and scooters
Currently the only lockup public bicycle spaces I know of were down Kivers Lane in an area that was not well supervised and made people feel their often very valuable bike was at risk of being vandalized or stolen. If we want to encourage more use of bicycles then we need to provide lock up spaces that are not hidden away.
covered cycle parks with good security for leaving your bike while shopping or at work.
"Perhaps the square could transformed into one such area. as for sport, may be a place for watching sport on big screens, a tennis centre."
"I want a lake, surrounding the Cathedral, flowing in and out from the river Avon. Make is big enough for recreational activity, like rowing canoeing, wind surfing, etc. and with lots of space around for walking and cycleway around it."
I would also like a theme park full of trees you can climb with flying foxes between them!
World class water sport area.
A people orientated space for recreation. welcome for all ages and a huge variety of activities.
"I think in our new central city we should have a farm, a bit like a zoo, but with only farm animals. And you can hold piglets and baby animals. You can also feed them. Firstly it would be fun for lots of people, secondly it would probably attract lots of people to Christchurch"
playground / interactive areas.
"Covered areas to practice Tai chi, yoga, and any other form of meditative awareness body practice."
"Bring in some sports facilities, swimming pools, and even a cricket green. The cricket green would be a pleasant green space for residents to enjoy and provide an open space."
Theme park
Create big theme parks eg.. Legoland
I think the new central city should have more public theme parks like rainbows end
Re-build QEII within the central city environment to encourage the sport fraternity into and as a part of inner city activity. Not isolated as QEII was pre-earthquake.
"Install a free public rock climbing wall in a central, sunny location with easy, medium & difficult sections."
Allow room for more playground areas with lots of trees and flowers to create a nice atmosphere for Christchurch replacing old buildings.
Have a lot more playgrounds and spaces to relax instead of industrial buildings.
There should be more areas for children to play in the CBD.
"Theme park, box forts, metal bars stood up and you could get inside them."
"Water parks – roof top overlooking city, adventure playgrounds."
Wet and really fun places. Flying fox – really tall one.
"Skate parks, bmx tracks, swings, band stands, etc, areas for people to play in the City"
I think we should get a massive skate park in the centre of the city.
"I want a skate park because there will be a lot of spare space and the skate parks are all really busy so we could use with another one also if you do build one you could build a youth cafe, to hang out and also a mini skate shop in case something breaks while your there."
plenty of activities for teenage children to enjoy like skate parks
More places for youth people to visit or hang out.
More space to kinda just hang out and chill
More places that younger people can hang out. Doesn't seem like central city has many places that lots of people can hang out.
"Dedicated place for teens, indoor café and pool tables, dartboards, hoops, etc.. We wonder why 14-17 year old boys hang around looking bored and get in trouble. We have to value and provide for our youth."
Teenagers will feel welcome there and will have things to do there and places to hang out with their friends and be themselves.
Cathedral Square would be a wonderful place for an outdoor ice skating rink in winter – replaced by tables and colourful umbrellas in summer with café food. Consider the rink in New York – Rockfeller Centre – as a model. This is set under ground level as can be observed from the public and out of the wind. Fantastic.
"Low rise buildings surrounding a courtyard with common use buildings surrounding a courtyard with common use buildings eg pool complex, gym."
Make lower buildings that are twice as strong as before the earthquake so people aren't so anxious to come into the central city
I want to have all buildings under two storeys high so that from the centre of town you can see the hills!!!! And the great view.
To make more earthquake proof buildings so people wont get scared to go back to work and will feel much safer around the central city.
"unless the CBD has mid rise (10 story) buildings, we will end up with a sprawl of 2 story buildings that go on forever, like Auckland has. A high density centre is necessary to make public transport work and to provide enough customers for cafes and shops"
"Obviously our buildings need to be designed for earthquakes and the land checked properly. I don't want a height restriction, places like in London where height restrictions were imposed have become uniform and boring. It is better to have a mixture. I would like to see 2 level shopping, with offices above up to 3 or 4 storeys with the odd 10-15 storey high building."
"Some new architecturally designed buildings would be nice to give some uniqueness to the central city with interconnecting malls and market streets. Some roof top green areas would be nice too. More plazas with nice water fountains and features would be good, with feature lighting to brighten up the city"
"The originality, good looks, and practical functioning of the city centre will also be what will attract tourists."
an attractive place we will be very proud of again
"Please, please, can buildings have some interesting features and ornamentation? We don't have to go Gothic, I love the HSBC building on Cambridge Terrace that uses colour and curves for interest. I just visited the University of Texas where even the newest buildings have pleasing design features that help them blend with the Spanish / American features of the old ones. One of the lovely features of the Arts Centre is its movement between spaces, and the colonnades, and changes in height, why not more modern buildings using this approach, not cubes and rectangles?"
Keep the buildings low rise & lets lots more natural light in to the city perhaps set back from the street frontage a little with green areas
Low rise with courtyards & greenspaces.
Buildings stepped back from footpaths with green space / gardens and seating. No car parking in front of shops.
Heaps of space and greenery between buildings.
Some interesting pieces of rubble such as Victorian facades could to be placed in key positions
"I don't want Calder Stewart style prefab concrete shopping buildings, these are simply ugly and have no place in a public space. Leave them for the industrial estates!!"
"low-rise, open spaces that can cope with future earthquakes"
"Follow Japan with quake safe technologies in buildings in the inner city because this will continue and have to learn to live around it. Incentives for builders, tenants in the centre city especially in green, quake safe technology."
"I feel concerned that CERA et al may not have a great deal of control over the finished shape of the central city because we have been told 50 % of building will remain, and I would think that the demolished buildings will be replaced by landlords who will have their commercial interests as their prime motivation."
"I'd like to see something in place to prevent the rebuild being a bits a, where the buildings complement each other and are energy smart."
Accept central control that stipulates cohesion with the overall plan
"I want consistent planning so we create a beautiful space combining life, business, the arts and which attracts visitors from the suburbs"
"A simple combination of retiring a portion of the section to green space and controlling building volume, would create a mix of building shapes, height and styles, intermixed with green."
Rescue / repair only iconic buildings that contribute to the vision of Christchurch (being old is not enough). For example keep arts centre because it provides quality spaces for people to recreate in.
"Rebuild some of the iconic heritage buildings, like the Arts Centre. Learn from what Dresden did after WWII. Don't run away from the past."
"Key buildings (cathedral, arts centre, museum etc) restored and future quake proofed."
the square and roman catholic basilica and provincial chambers.
"main heritage buildings restored – Cathedral, Basilica, Provincial Chambers, Art Centre."
"The Dux De Lux on the corner of Montréal and Hereford Street. It is a vital part of attracting locals and tourists back into the central city, and is a cultural hub for all generations in this city. Don't let Ken Franklin throw the Dux out from their internationally recognised iconic site."
"The art centre complex first and foremost, I feel it is the cultural heart of our city. Spent plenty of time there and miss it greatly. The cafes also especially Dux De Lux – it wont be the same if it has to go somewhere else."
Make arts centre trust board allow Richard to reopen Dux de Lux. The city needs it now.
"demo all cbd buildings and start again 3 levels same as art gallery make new heritage with a few old eg cathedral, arts centre, museum."
I want Modern Arts centre to compliment the existing Art Gallery. We can not afford the money to restore the former.
"Apartments to house the people, we need people living in the central city to help create the vibrancy."
"I would also like more buildings converted to apartments. so its not cupboard like, and so the centre city is vibrant & full of people"
I don't want slum-type housing areas.
Low rise buildings with more residential apartments – no more than four stories high and with open green spaces that are shared.
"Apartment blocks are needed, but done with care and sustainability in mind. Low rise, maybe two or three storeys, with courtyards and green areas."
High density housing built around squares / green courtyards
Affordable inner city apartments with adjoining parks and gardens.
Allow 35-40m2 1-2 person apartments to be built in blocks of 4 on L1 land in place of 1 large house.
Student cheap accommodation in the city area to encourage students to live there.
"Architecturally designed student accommodation with water features, grassed areas and granite sets used for paving and pathways. Design a city that our uni graduates will be proud to work and live in and one which will encourage them to return after their o.e. Bring our young people into the central city."
"Look at encouraging youth students accommodation around the polytechnic and housing for university students and a tram to access the university, Riccarton through Hagley Park."
"4 to 6 story high, mixed use built space"
These spaces are edged by low scale mixed use buildings at ground level galleries / retail / restaurants and cafes. Above ground level work offices / studios (live / work units) and residential / hotel accommodation.
we would if the housing was affordable and there was space around.
"Mixing up social types of housing is also a good idea. Fundamental flaws are the lack of education and other facilities for families. Increase number of central city services, e.g. schools, public spaces, family / pet friendly areas, medical (people / life etc)."
Low rise buildings with garden spaces linked by bridges & air bridges.
"Colonnades on pillars on all road frontages in the centre, all at same height, with footbridges across streets at first floor level."
"I don't want Roads cutting across safe cycling and walking routes. Bridges could be built for roads to cross over the river, without disturbing the movement along the riverside."
More bridges over the Avon river for better access within tow / central suburbs.
I think the new central city should have a swing bridge across the Avon river and in the middle of it there should be a flying fox for which you can jump onto and drop and go all the way to the end and pull the rope back up.
glassed floor bridges and spaces over the river.
"A totally smoke-free central city. If we're not brave enough to try that, how about smoke-free zones around restaurants, cafes, and bars?"
"need eclectic, creative small enterprise in the central city."
No more eyesores such as the Farmers car park in Vic square or the Rebel sports monstrosity.
No distribution warehouses in the central city (you listening Canterbury Brewery) Use compulsory purchase orders to deliver a vision
"within the 4 avenues should be things that service the public directly, a brewery warehouse so close to the park, river, and hospital does not."
I miss the ease of ‘ catching up with friends and colleagues somewhere central and where to go and how long will it take?
"I want town to be the same as it was; vibrant shopping, places for socialising, central meeting points."
More places for youth to gather in a safe environment.
"Community areas to gather and meet, hireable spaces – community support to answer queries, security concerns e.g. city hosts; identifiable coats to ask."
Bookable meeting spaces
Cashel mall & adjoining areas with retractable roof that cover the whole street for bad weather.
seating covered lanes linking retail shopping areas to create a village atmosphere.
I want Places for kids that are from 10-15 to socialise and meet new friends.
A place for teenagers to congregate that will be attractive to them. Older people who often feel intimidated by large groups of young people.
"I think that there should be a place in which younger people (13-16) can meet up, have a chat and have some thing to eat. This could be like a cafe or something else. Just somewhere for people like me and my friends to meet up in the weekend and have fun :)"
Places for young adults to meet and have fun without intimidating other users of the city.
A bigger and better convention centre – this is a great opportunity for Christchurch to increase revenue from conferences and corporate events.
An international quality convention centre with conference facilities to attract worldwide meetings to Christchurch.
Ensure some areas out of the cold wind and design for passive solar heat retention!!
Place buildings with 5 star certified green buildings – all low with lots of natural light and green roofs.
"Low rise apartments with solar heating, really well insulated shared communal play areas, walkways linking them to parks and other family amenities."
"Eco city, water from roofs used for watering green areas and gardens"
I want all rain water re-used for irrigating green spaces.
More green space integrated with stormwater treatment systems (the Avon River currently receives vast amounts of untreated stormwater filled with various contaminants).
All rain water re-used for irrigating green spaces.
Solar powered lighting in the inner city (businesses receive tax or rate rebates) for contributing to lighting public space
Think more than central city. All new houses should have solar water heating; & rainwater and / or greywater tanks for toilet and garden use.
"For the central city, reduction in motor traffic will improve the air quality."
"Make the city more environmentally friendly; more public transport, public gardens / parks, more bike lanes, use eco-friendly materials etc.."
"Resort like Accommodation for the Tourists intertwined with the Avon River, to keep us beautiful Green & Attractive for Tourism to Prosper."
"Use renewable energy solutions for every rebuild that takes place, make Christchurch the clean, green paragon of progressive development"
"Another huge issue we believe needs to be addressed is the lack of rubbish bins in the central city and surrounding suburbs. We realise bins were taken away to encourage people to take their rubbish with them, but from practical experience gained from conducting numerous river / street clean ups, this philosophy is clearly not working. Also the lack of specially designed bins that can take recycling and cigarette butts in the rubbish bins or having separate cigarette bins beside normal bins is another issue we feel should be dealt with. There are so many cigarette butts littered on Christchurch streets; this isn't aesthetically pleasing and has an environmental impact as the chemicals leach into the waterways and affect the fragile ecosystems. Other cities in Europe have rubbish bins with many different slots for recycling and cigarette butts."
Park and ride – places to park outside the city centre with regular green energy efficient buses to take troopers back and forth
Only electric buses & trains in central city
"Better looking public place, recycling station"
Have low rent commercial / shop spaces so businesses that were lost in the earthquakes are more likely to attempt to open.
"Make sure there are small, low-rent spaces for the quirky micro-businesses that give the city character and are never found in malls."
Have a business areas where self employed people could rent space and work in a community environment and share resources.
"Business returning en masse will be a small miracle, so there will need to be other reasons to congregate. It will be full of people talking and sitting, a place for people to come together, in an unstructured manner, more like a bar or common room than a concert hall or theatre."
A potential conflict in this area is that some want international businesses some no multinationals. Possibly international business but no multinational retail.
I think many spaces (and buildings) should be left as long-term spaces for temporary projects. Land owners should be given rates holidays if they give over vacant sites and buildings for temporary creative projects.
"Council flexibility on the rules for a set limited time, say 5 years & allow temporary hut type buildings in the empty spaces while they are needed. Precincts where like businesses cluster & people also live, giving a more villagy atmosphere Covered market type spaces for everyday use to make retail business more flexible until the city gets established."
Rent free spaces for pop up shops / cafes. Boost the space filler initiatives.
Reduce the number of zoning classifications for central city and business zones to create fewer city-wide categories. No special status for the central city and no premiums charged on rates.
Amalgamate titles of city blocks; clear sites 4 storey buildings with space between them.
"Matters such as building heights should be driven by market forces. If the owner builds to new code requirements, and tenants are willing to occupy the space, then that should be the determinitive factor. Taller buildings give a city credibility. We will not attract big business, and importantly, investment, to Christchurch, if it looks like a large scale Ashburton, or Canberra. Most CBD properties in Christchurch are owned by high net worth individuals. They will invest elsewhere if they can not make an adequate return on their capital. Without them, the CBD will quickly die."
"Land and buildings in industrial, business, central city and residential zones to be measured and monitored on a comparable basis by way of a productive land-use monitoring unit i.e., whether vacant or in use, quantity of greenspace or provided on site, how long vacant, potential interim uses after period of disuse. Penalties to be imposed on owners of sites who engage in purely speculative land-banking (and demolition by neglect) where temporary ecological, cultural or social activities of value to the city could be carried out. Financial incentives to site owners who forego revenue from parking lot development to enable such alternative uses."
"Do anything possible that could INCENTIVISE developer to create buildings of merit, tax break, rates reduction, area concessions etc!"
By 2020 a new or retrofitted building in Cathedral Square will host New Zealand's first Centre for Urban Ecology which explains how Christchurch has been affected by natural processes and how it has adapted to such events in order to harmonise the needs of people and nature.
"The June 2011 Readers Digest has a very interesting article on page 72 titled The Future of Farming. It is actually about growing food plants in cities by gardening on the outside of high rise buildings or in environmentally controlled buildings where the crops are rotated on a shifting elevatior system. With food grown in the central city this way, there is little or no cost in transportation. It sounds very futuristic and way out, but well worth consideration."
"I want buildings built in wood low rise organic and eco systems established at the beginning, building codes that show affordable eco systems to sustain our world, christchurch has such exciting opportunities. Lets be passionate and think outside the square for solutions."
"Science and Technology is the future for NZ. CHCH is the S&T capital of NZ and as such should have a science and technology hub in the centre of the city where Universities, Polytechnics, industry are able to show the amazing work that they do to the public. This hub should be anchored by a new National Science Centre which would provide NZ citizens access to the innovation that is occuring in our city, increasing their scientific understanding, exciting kids about the wonders of science and providing life long learning opportunities for everyone. It would also be a major tourist attraction for the city with visitor able to see examples of Kiwi ingenuity."
Establish a research park that is adjacent to commercial hub to prosper a collaborative innovation community.
Reward people who are willing to take a risk and invest in new and better ways to take a risk and invest in new and better ways to do things that reduce the carbon footprint of the city – in the suburbs as well as the city centre.
"Collective ownership of city blocks. Individual owners of fragmented titles, owning 300 or 600 square metres each. Trying to maximise their individual return – building completely to their title boundaries. Should be ‘ encouraged toward a shareholding or collective ownership of an entire city block. A collective owned building – would then not need to build covering an entire block area."
"Dedicated orchard as a park. Give away fruit in Autumn. Cider & jam-making classes, and a series of novel retail and brewers alongside"
"Snow park. Indoor snow park like Auckland has. Will generate money, tourist attraction for skiers and snowboarders during summer (and all year round)."
Entertainment spaces i.e. buskers / outdoor
"Accessibility – good public transport, park and ride outside four avenues, more cycle ways independent of roads, better bike lock up racks"
"Encourage businesses to break free of traditional work spaces, give staff opportunity for access to adjacent green spaces during breaks, rooftop breakout spaces etc"
"Free ultra fast wireless broadband within 4 avenues. This will attract people, creativity and business to central city. It would connect central city to global community."
Central city should have free wifi to encourage tourists & travelers to linger but on logging on should show a video promoting Canterbury
"I want Free to user, public access, broadband wi-fi, across the city centre (whatever that may be)."
I would like more gardens and public space. Parks and gardens and free wifi around the city. nice shops and creative workshops and fun things for kids!
"Offer tourist-friendly things like phone recharging points incorporated into public spaces so that backpackers and tourists can tell their friends and the world what a clued up, switched on cool place the new Christchurch is."
"I like the concept of several villages almost self sufficient. Also the idea of different land use hubs e.g. Artisans area, a place where visual artists can live work and sell products. Public transport only to the edge of the CBD suggest 3 depots then small electric shuttles around the streets."
More affordable living spaces in the central city.
"A far more compact CBD, with precincts for tech, cultural, historic, retail, professional, surrounded by mixed residential & green space."
The central city needs to be more confined in space.
The central city should be far more compact than it was. three or four level apartment or 2 storey terrace house type denser residential accomodation in the CBD needs to be encouraged.
"CBD needs to be confined to area bordered by Montreal, Kilmore, Madras and St Asaphs-or smaller area"
"Review & reduce the extent of the CBD / Central City Zone. It needs to be more compact (to ensure, for example, its walkability)."
I want much the same as what is already there but in a smaller space. Reduce the CBD to within the confines of the one-way street square grid and open the leftover space between the one way streets and the 4 avenues for higher density housing
Open spaces for performance and entertainment. These will encourage people to come and live in the city.
"I want a vibrant city with a mixture of retail, commercial, entertainment & housing, A city market on the lines of Victoria market in Melbourne. This would bring the central city alive and make it a pleasant place to live work & play."
"Full of people, full of vivacity and people with jobs in central city. A beautiful place, where people choose to live and work."
"The central city needs people, life and activity."
"People working and living in centre. Places for people to chill, resturants, cafe, NICE library, green spaces, markets. not bars / drunks"
A lot of comments regarding more vibrant living in the central city – generally creating more life.
Residential but also to allow access for families to live in – not the quarter acre but somewhere to sit and eat at home with easy access to green space outside.
"A desirable place to live and interact, for young people, families and interested older people."
"Instead of storage spaces, create living quarters above shops and offices. Inner city living is preferred by many young residents and keep the city lively at any day."
"One thing that needs to be considered if people are to live in the city is the problem of noise. Young people in particular tend to stay up later and let their hair down, and part of that is noise, which is no good if others are nearby trying to sleep. Perhaps the use of specific precincts like Sol Square might help with this?"
"Mixed use is key, retail, Hospitality at ground, commercial office / Tourism accom above with City living above that and lots green space."
the housing should be a variety from studio like new york to units with a number of bedrooms & in places terrace type housing.
"A living space needs smaller scale, affordable options for buying groceries without using a car, for being entertained without travelling half way across the city."
rooftop green space
"Central city living would appeal if I could shop, relax and entertain without having to use the car."
"There will be plenty of opportunities to work and play in the city centre but previously there were limited opportunities to access supermarkets without a car particularly in the north, east and west. They don't need to be large format supermarkets, and preferably they would be smaller."
"green vibrant place were transport is first by foot, then cycling, public transport, commercial and lastly private. Without people living, working a and being able to get to and from the city we will not have a central city."
"want Places where people can live and work eg small business like an optometrist where there may be only a couple of people working there. Have an apartment above the business. This way you use less petrol, better security, more flexible working hours, more people living in central city."
We need to attract young people into the city centre to live. and work. Accomodation and transport must be designed to meet their needs.
use a place like victoria square for produce and food market market
We would like to see the Art Centre market return to the Art Centre market area or the Art centre side pavement of Worcester Boulevard (on a temporary trial basis from August 1st until the completion of the rugby world cup).
"Mixed use development – more activity in central city in the evenings – cathedral square designed as people space, more like European and Australian public spaces with cafes / attractions to keep people in the square past 5 o'clock. Also creates a city that tourists will see as a pleasant and attractive place to stimulating the local business economy."
People living and working and recreating there. A sense of place derived from small scale features rather than big overpowering structures. Lanes to explore and discover for tourists and locals alike. A sense of discovery for shoppers as well as other city visitors who are simply there to enjoy what it has to offer.
"Cultural – art gallery, museum, court theatre. Fun – art centre, market, entertainment, buskers. Variety of people – tourists and locals."
"It will have a low profile, lots of sunshine, a wide array of vegetation, quiet and friendly. Overall it will have been designed for those who live in the greater Christchurch area. This type of city will be better because locals will use it and tourists will come to enjoy what we have."
"Central city space for locals, not just tourists."
Not too many tourist aimed public places as the city should be aimed at an enjoyable place for those who live there.
"Themed events for bringing tourists to town. Festival of lights in winter so we can see the lights. A bigger Chinese lantern festival, it is in a place that is too small."
"By creating the central city as a creative and cultural centre, this celebrates Christchurch's unique musical, artistic and cultural talents that we have offered new zealand and are a big attraction for tourists and top performers, musicians etc"
"Need to have a mix of things to get people in – apartments, cafes, bars, open areas, entertainments, cafes, bars, open areas, entertainment (fun parks.4. Something dynamic for tourists e.g. earthquake simulator outdoors, broken crockery mosaic"
"Earthquake tourism? Education centre, displays."
Resort like Accommodation for the Tourists intertwined with the Avon River
Speciality shops and café / restaurant culture. The Avon river an open ribbon meandering through our city with an uninterrupted pedestrian and cycle track along both sides – extended beyond the central city the length of the river. Bike hire for tourists?
A large farmers market in The Square to draw locals into the city center. Everyone including tourists will enjoy the buzz
"I want safe areas for tourists. Controlled, drinking / mixing / socialising"
Get rid of cars in the city centre (1 square km). Creating more foot traffic friendly areas. Just look at Welly and how popular cuba st is
"Big complex including cinema, theatre, concert hall and recreation space will be very useful to improve mental health of Christchurch people."
"Sculptures, seating, grass areas, using recycled stone and timber from the buildings & cloisters of shops, eateries & cafes. Areas for live music."
"Have Council rent assisted spaces for emerging designers to work and sell from, clothing, jewellery, art, weaving, metal, glass etc.."
"If the city draws locals it will draw tourists. Let's be unique not a theme park. Focus on quality not tat, one-offs not big chains."
"Put a farmers / food & craft market at the centre of the city, surrounded by specialist food retail and restaurants, a gastrodome!"
"Build / Develop a Central City Market, for Fresh Produce. Examples are Victoria Market in Melbourne and Adelaide Central Market"
"Restore iconic buildings, Cathedrals, Provincial Council Chambers, Cashel Mall facades, Arts Centre and Museum"
Forget rebuilding the Christ Church Cathedral in the old style build a world leading modern design. It will be an icon in the square
replicating post-colonial architecture will only make Christchurch look like a theme park
How about a large Marae in the centre of the city plaza in the open (not in a museum).
"A reflection of our cultural heritage (Maori and European) and diversity, not just a crass commercial centre."
I don't want a Maori cultural centre.
Open up the avon river. make it open and accessible. Make it a stand out feature. let us look and see the avon. Allow our buildings to face it and not turn away.
Enhance and strengthen unique natural features and landscape types along the river. Create an interpretive walkway that extends from Hagley Park to the Spit Reserve with historical and ecological information
"Extend the green spaces in the CBD, especially around the river"
"Green area along Avon, like in Adelaide."
please don't replace all the deciduous trees with natives. I think we should use a mix of both exotic and native plants to enhance the river and keep views of it
More green spaces and memorial gardens. A place for people to sit and contemplate
Would like to see park setting / memorial in CTV space.
The CTV and PGC sites to become memorial parks with plaques for the deceased and adequate lighting to minimise crime in these areas. Park benches for people to sit and remember loved ones as well as thoughtful plantings
"Reflection area in CBD as a memorial walkway with trees for each of those that died Maybe an avenue of paving, lawn, seats & small plaques"
"Make a memorial walkway, each family who lost loved one to select a mosaic pattern to place in walkway made from broken china and old bricks"
"Earthquake memorial museum, create a wonderful building which shows us the old / the broken and the new Christchurch. ' A slice of time including earthquake stimulator space to experience the 6.3"
There will be a place where the story of the earthquakes and rebuild will be told – the Canterbury Museum seems the obvious place for that
International earthquake research centre / museum / memorial (to recognise the impact of earthquakes on Christchurch)
Create an open air theatre space for free public performances
"more spaces for outdoor entertainment, busking & concerts, versatile areas"
"A 200 seat outdoor amphitheatre would be a great place for concerts, children's plays during the summer holidays, buskers, or just to hang out during lunch"
"Some professional spaces for The Court, CSO but others not dominated by the university or other groups but spaces that are changing and provide for all sorts of groups"
At least one awesomely epic theatre. Make places like the court theatre larger and more modern.
"A central theatre, tying in the with museum and art gallery would be great"
The School of Art and Design and the National Academy of Singing and Dramatic Art could have a much larger presence with galleries and performance spaces
"quality venues for cinema, theatre, arts and music blended with outdoor entrainment areas (Sound shell) set amongst green areas with lots of cafes, bars and restaurants"
"To the west around the arts centre a cultural area should be encouraged, less office space, more residential and entertainment centres. Cafes, restaurants, perhaps new performance spaces built in the now empty areas"
"Centre of excellence for music, arts etc – build on the excellent new art gallery theme"
"AVON RIVER? a continuous promenade with lots of interesting cafes, art studios and public art. A place for all to enjoy day and night."
I want Murals. Beautify the ugly bland blank spaces
I love the festivals we have that bring people in-so we need spaces that allow and stimulate gathering.
"A combined visual and performing arts centre with affordable gallery, studio and performance space for arts organisations in Christchurch"
"Create frequent live free entertainment in central city. Give musicians a chance to perform freely, bit like busking but more organised"
We love outdoor theatre and music so plan for open spaces where we can sit and be entertained.
"a city with open areas for artist. spaces to paint, stages to dance, a city that turns heart ache into creative inspiration for others"
"Galleries, studio spaces for our local artists, clubs for musicians to play in"
"Support for the arts in the form of cheap spaces for studios, practice rooms, galleries etc.."
"The arts centre with its activities, café's, Dux de Lux, Court theatre, movie theatres – the guest space the art centre has had and a place to meet up with visitors and friends"
"The central city should be a magnet for cultural events, during daytime and night time"
I want more festivals in central city to celebrate the diverse makeup of our people and their cultures
I want large open spaces for community and cultural activity.
"I would love for Christchurch's CBD to be more of an artistic hub, which is an odd thing considering my artistic illiteracy. The CBD should be the centre for all forms of arts and culture."
Having people living close to their work places and to the cultural centres with community gardens and green parks close to where they live
"I believe the key is having affordable apartments for both young and old, creating a safe friendly environment for everyone, the mix makes it so much more interesting and keeps otherwise ‘ lonely empty spaces safe after hours"
"I want more of a village feel, small businesses, open malls, parks and community gather spots"
"I want people friendly spaces, markets, outdoor meeting places, parks + green spaces"
"A place where neighbours talk to each other, work together"
Attract families to city with flats and 2 storied townhouses; include play areas and communal garden spaces in same traffic free block
"If social services, shopping and other residents needs are available in short travel distances that don't require the use of a personal automobile, lower income families can live in the new central Christchurch in a more sustainable manner"
I would move to the CBD if I could find a flat with fenced space for the kids to play and room to garden (either private or communal). This flat would need to have a high diversity of shops within an easy walk
"Encourage UC City campus, music and theatre schools, and more study space in the central library"
"The CBD should be the centre for commerce in Chch, so the Canty Uni law & commerce faculties should be there"
"Develop the area around the polytech, student village where they can show of art, theatre etc"
"I think the CPIT, UC and Lincoln Uni have a great opportunity to contribute to the lifestyle, business and learning in the central city"
"Community (post-school) education venues in the central city, now that high schools have mostly lost their activities."
Don't understand the opposition some have on here to schools. Cities thrive on being places where all ages co-exist & interact
It will be easier for people working or living in the central city if their kids can be catered for
"No schools, kids need space to run around not city shops"
"A place I can feel safe in, from being hit by fast-moving traffic, from being mugged by drunken individuals. Minimise liquor outlets and pubs."
"Good lighting, open spaces, police presence with control over bars and drinking"
it will not have a bus exchange in the centre – always seemed very dodgy area
no one feeling afraid or intimated when walking around the square
"PLEASE separate out the fast food outlets, ie McDonalds, KFC etc into different areas with no public seating nearby to discourage a recurrence of the anti-social behaviours (littering and mass loitering) seen before the quake."
The central city always felt seedy and unsafe. Our family never went there. It should be a place for people to gather and relax
If Cathedral Square were to imitate many latin city squares the place would be more attractive to visitors due to its enhanced function and the safety afforded by a large number of decent eyes surrounding it
"Concentrate activity, vibrant city centre, active street frontages, active and passive surveillance, mixed use, encourage more residents"
I want the central city able to withstand an 8.0 earthquake with little damage
"The most important vision for the city to me is that the city is earthquake proof. I would not be happy if everyone enjoyed having the Cathedral Square finished being built and then we have another earthquake that destroys it again, that would be devastating"
safe zones for people to congregate like Victoria Square or large green areas accessible quickly if an earthquake does happen
I want no buildings over 2 stories. People need to feel safe if they are going to return to the central city
"If police are shifting to new buildings, the communications centre must be safe. Same with St. Johns and Fire Department. Civil Defence to have their own bunker out of the CBD with good road access, good yards for other associated groups, e.g., dog rescue and other similar groups"
Encourage the rebuild of a dedicated centrally located emergency services combined communciations centre in a state of the art building that can continue to function after further earthquakes
Well-lit pedestrian areas and cycle ways
Well lit streets and open spaces
"Have real people living in the city centre, all ages and stages so everyone has a stake in keeping it safe and making a community"
"Ensure nightime waiting areas for public transport are brightly lit, kept clean, & have police or security wardens present at all times"
I would like to see the adult sex shops removed from the city centre-they give it a seedy appearance

Compact Central City with later shopping hours
"Have once a month or fortnight night festivals in square, bands, food and crafts stalls and other entertainment (street performers)"
"You need after work activities. Cooking schools, Language schools, indoor sports centres, hot pools, civilized bars"
"easy, safe & cheap transport or parking, if i have to spend 30 mins looking for a park or 45 mins btw public transport i do nt go to city"
Central city public toilets ON GROUND LEVEL with good kids changing facilities and maybe a parents room for feeding like in Malls
"An accessible central city, where people of all motilities, ages, and cultures can move into and within easily, with access to green and accessible transport options. Everyone should be able to access all the new features developed, regardless of disability"
"Fit and healthy city. walk, cycle, jog tracks. obstacle course lunchtime open dance. climbing wall. green space for improvised football / touch"
A gym / swim complex adjacent to Hagley Park for a one stop fitness / fun stop suitable for both locals and tourists alike
"Family areas, no smoking anywhere outside"
"I love the idea of a smokefree city! Or if not possible, at least having smoke free areas like by the river and in the busy shopping areas"
Edible community gardens with fruit trees herbs and veges that families can access include among the areas of relaxation
"We need the Youth Health Centre back, with a whole bunch of youth services based there"
"Innovative, connected health services and social welfare centres for the primary health care needs and wellness needs of the community"
Places people and youth could go free / affordable services like health club / counselling-drop in places making it more accessible
"I also miss the beautiful buildings and the shops. I miss all of the central city really and just want it back. I miss just the comfortable feel of it, like it wasn't to over the top or too old, it was just right"
The trauma and stress that arises from the rebuild will need to be taken into consideration and services need to be in place
Put a one stop resting place and have snack stalls to let people enjoy because of the stress that they have been put through since Feb 22nd
"empty spaces can be utilised as mini parks. provide places to relax, reflect, contemplate & create. This idea is not for the long term, but. it is important for the emotional wellbeing of Christchurch people to have these areas used as we create & rebuild our city"
A place for civic engagement and covered places to meet that are free
Christchurch should be a beautiful safe place with many interesting things to do
"I want Free stuff. Outdoor activities, parks, concerts, festivals, that don't cost. Family stuff that families can afford. Free shuttles around the city Open air areas and village green areas for picnics, lounging, sport, playgrounds"
"Plus more places to move and play – kick a ball, throw a Frisbee, play with a kid!"
A village green in square so people can play social cricket or sit around in sunchairs drinking wine while they have picnics & watch / talk
"youthful open spaces that provide for all activities including skateboarding, art, music and sculpture"
"An approachable, people friendly space that caters for a mix of activities, cafes, restaurants, parks, art galleries, bars and clubs, activities for families and the elderly"
"Make it more family orientated to encourage people at the weekends, with great spaces for lunches and shoppers with outside cultural events and spaces"
"Central community area with large ice skating, gym and swimming complex to get families back into CBD. see how done in New York-magic!!"
"Have sports equipment like soccer balls, rugby balls etc, that you can borrow and play with in the parks"
For the central city to be a real destination especially at weekends
"The central city should be a place that draws people in, with attractive public spaces that. host a wide range of events"
"Participation. Community. Let it be a place people want to be, not one where people hurry into and out of or through"
"want it to be a place where people would want to go, rather than have to go (eg. work) It would be nice to have a kind of vibe with street culture and a big assortment of all kinds of shops friendly environments and experiences (with some arguing businesses will prosper as a result)"
If areas are set up with cultural and social focus they will draw in people and businesses will follow filling spaces accordingly
The people! The people! The people! Remember successful commerce is dependent on social interaction. For social interaction to happen the city centre or CPD (central peoples district) needs to be an attractive safe and inclusive space
"Entertainment, safety, ease of access, easy and cheap parking, traffic-free zones, attractive riverside areas"
"open green spaces, markets, open air cafes (like Paris), carnival type atmosphere. Pet friendly too!"
"City was lacking in family-orientated things, get some of the central city parks loaded with play areas for the kids"
More play areas for the kids – then the parents will be there as well!!!
"Make it more of a family place, kids aswell, because before it was a tad scary"
"Everything young whanau need in pram pushing distance, ie ability to walk to parks, natural areas, doctor, plunket, libraries"
Make the CBD a destination for families and children. perhaps a more central playground and park / picnic area with organised family events
A central play / family area will bring a lot of families back into city
A place where families feel welcome. Lets keep the escorts strip joints ‘ adult shops in a confined area
I want more recognition of maori culture. We have a massive Christian cathedral in the centre of our town so why not a traditional inspired meeting hall for cultural events
"NO Maori entertainment culture demonstrated in public places in the city. We don't put on demos for European culture, so why should Maori?"
I want more places for the youth to gather in a safe environment
"I Want A Place Where Teens Can Go And Hang Out, Like A Night Club But For Teens With No Alcohol So We Have A Place To Hang Out And So We're Not Out Causing Trouble Other Places"
"All generations, all ethnic groups, the able and disabled need to feel welcome in central Christchurch"
"Massive cultural diversity in a condensed area, encouraged by the many businesses, shops, educational facilities, cafes and tourist destinations, but above all, being around my fellow Christchurch dwellers, the people"
"We have a new deep sense of community and it's important our new inner city encourages that, cafes, squares, places we want to be to be together"
More public buildings and outdoor spaces for people to enjoy their days.
"seating – sheltered in a green spaces, quiet places, well scattered so breaks can breaks can be taken and enjoyed, wind breaks from east / west winds"
integrative residential areas (not retirement villages)
We want to make Christchurch central a HUMAN FRIENDLY CITY.
"Start with the idea of a Central People District (C.P.D.), the heart of an environmentally, socially and economically sustainable city"
"Ditch the CBD and build a CPD, a central people's district, in which human activity is encouraged. Imagine people friendly space that is a destination."
I want make the CBD a Central Peoples District (CPD). Put the public transport hub in the centre of the CPD
Build a new Community House to provide space for the non-profit organisations. Have council liason / mayor fund on site too.
"A place for all social-economic people – the people of city mission and other social agencies, the people of arts and education, the mothers and their special needs of caring for children and elderly"
not just an elite upmarket space for rich or tourists. Need community oriented places and organisations
"Free, fast and clean inner-city transport e.g. monorail. We don't need cars in the central city if this happens."
We want the central city to be skate board friendly and accessible by skaters (easy routes to town)
"Heaps of people, and safe visible places to catch taxis, buses or park a bike"
"Better transport options and remember taxis are also public transport. They should work in partnership and co-operate more. Put taxi stands near bar, cafes and areas where the public congregate, making it a safe and vibrant place for young and old."
"The Melbourne free tram concept is to take people (residents and visitors) to places they may not otherwise go to. In particular it takes people to new retail areas, arts and entertainment and food and beverage locations. It is very well used. A Chch free tram on the extended route would take more people to areas such as High Street while also performing a service for those needing to move around the central city."
An integrated public transport system that leverages existing tram networks and is designed to reduce transport costs and improve the speed of getting from populated areas to the city.
Low cost tram around the central city
Please please continue with the tram project but make it affordable for all to use to bring people into the city while providing outlying car parking areas and the trams bring people to the new city centre. eg If you pay for 2 hours parking that will also include transport by tram to the city. I love the trams back in our city but in past couple of years they have become too expensive to take visitors just for a one off ride!
"Good fast public transport linking areas so that people would use every day not just once a year. With a lot of older buildings down that the tram network was going to show off, redesign the routs and units to allow fast delivery of people to different areas. Set up from the Uni to the coast"
"I would love to see a comprehensive tram system to get us around the central city, which could connect to commuter rail to the outer suburbs"
Lite rail or modern trams such as in Zurich which take commuters from a central transport hub such as the old Railway station in Moorhouse Ave into the central city.
"If it meant less cars in the inner city I am all for it, would free up walking space and make it safer for us all with less cars"
"little pollution, relaxing form of travel, do nt need parking, less traffic in central city"
Melbourne is a great place to look at for ideas. i can picture myself hoping on a tram in the CBD and getting off at Sumner beach.nice!
Don't design just for tourists eg current tram loop waste of space. Needs to be part of getting around the city for all users.
I want a light rail transport system that goes through the central city and branches out to each suburb with it's own docking station that brings people to the central city.
I want light rail system using a spoke system from the suburbs to a central hub.
Light rail service to the suburbs based on the present rail network with links to eastern city and through southern suburbs and to Sumner. Centre this on old Railway station with interchange to buses.
Link Riccarton to the Central City by tram / light rail through Hagley Park.

"I want modern light rail system from suburbs hubs with park and ride to and from city, get public transport usable"
"No light rail-waste of money and space, use buses better, make cycle ways better. ; No more tram extensions, mono rail or light rail inside 4 avenues."
Pedestrians should take priority over cars. I want to be able to walk around the city centre.
A restful not frantic space with green places and / or corridors providing a safe environment for pedestrians and cyclists
Attractive lanes and pedestrian linkages between the different areas
"I don't want stones or paving which when it gets wet you can slip on. The ones in the square are very bad for this, it affects people who cant walk easily and old folk."
- the central city to be so pedestrian focused that my 90 year old dad could get around it safely `
"Extensive pedestrian only areas, with trees, shops, restaurants, cosy and intimate spaces to be and spend time"
"Keep cars out! People like malls because parking is easy, and you can walk around shops without traffic. Make the city centre like this. Parking buildings near edge, pedestrian only around shops and bars. Access by car only before 8 am"
"Pedestrianised centre for shops, bars, restaurants, with safe bike routes out into the suburbs, like nice European cities."
"Walking routes around the river, fountains and art in the streets"
I want spaces where it is safe to walk and I don't have to wait to cross roads where cars are dominant.
"cut back transport in central city. Make it safe for pedestrians, more walkways"
I don't want to feel unsafe when I walk through the city after dark. E.g. don't make places where youth want to congregate and cause trouble.
"More green areas, enhance the spaces around the Avon, include some ways of making it safer for pedestrians at night, e.g. well lit spaces, CCTV. Eco-friendly City e.g; no cars, public transport only, bikes and plenty of trees."
"Safe, well lit people friendly, pedestrian areas only places to promote ease of getting around for disabled and the less mobile people."
"Safety cameras day and night, With well lit areas where pedestrians go."
Moving the cars out of the central city for a start to encourage walking.
"Greater restrictions on traffic. More walking and cycling. Let's make the city centre a place for people, not cars."
"Take footpaths (& cycleways) across side streets in central city, so priority is given to pedestrians / cyclists over cars."
Living screens to break strong winds. Wider footpaths and / or More pedestrian only areas. More covered walkways for protection.
"Have covered pedestrian streets, open areas of seating / landscaping."
"Eliminate cars in Central City; replace them with cheap / free and efficient public transport, e.g. light rail, monorail."
"Take the bus depot from the city centre. Columbo St was awful, trying to dodge buses and the hoards of people waiting for their bus."
"No buses going down columbo street. make pedestrian only from the square to the bus exchange, so its one big space."
"More trams, more bikes, car & bus free centre."
"remove big stinky, noisy busses from the very centre of the city."
move bus exchange from the cbd to the old sale yards site or to turners and growers site and provide a tram link to the square
I want Bus exchange on outskirts of main CBD and then shuttle to centre.
One central exchange. Limited bus numbers.
"Keep the bus exchange in the central city, it is important that it is sited so that it is equally accessible to everybody"
I want Easy bus access. Central exchange.
Keep central bus exchange in city centre.
Keep our excellent bus service. Very central bus exchange to encourage people to use public transport
"Bus exchange on outskirts of main CBD and then shuttle to centre. No motorised vehicles in main CBD area, walking and cycling only, needs to be easy to navigate / more around."
A public transport system that keeps as many as possible buses out of the heart of the city using very frequent shuttles into the centre and free.
I want public transport that is more reliable than a bus light rail monorail subway etc free carparks in outlying suburbs to allow commuters and workers to drive to these points for easy and fast access to the centre city
bus exchange outside four avenues with free bus or light rail into centre.
"No underground bus exchange, bring the central square interchange back."
"I want put buses and tram station underground in the square, like it used to be and in the park on top. Cafes bars and business in around the square, rebuild cathedral as multi use building with cafes business and church"
"Also, the bus lanes can be ridiculously oversized and take up too much road space. Perhaps put the lanes in the centre of the road so they won't disrupt arcing on the side of the road."
Move the bus exchange to a more practical location (near the city but not right in the centre) e.g. Tuam Street / Barbadoes / Lichfield / Madras block (currently empty).
Address the bus depot location and move that to a better location so that buses don't clogg the busy streets that padestrians use often in the very centre of the city.
"The bus exchange has to be moved, idiotic having it blocking a signature area."
I also want the original bus exchange. I want this because I like to travel around the city and cant really do that right now due to the bus exchange being in a different place.
"Also bring back 1 central bus station. its a pain having to take shuttles from one station to the other when I get the bus, i do use the busses. I suspect that the people who want two stations don't actually use them"
The bus hub needs to be fairly central so that people can access the rest of the CBD on foot.
"we still need a central bus exchange, people will not want to catch a bus to an external bus exchange and then another but into the city"
"Avoid old bus exchange problems – cold, dark, people smoking – need to be more people friendly, more green space on street stop areas"
DON'T WANT the bus exchange in the middle of city centre. Create the feeling of being intimidated by a number of young persons in group hanging around the area
"I want more cycle ways and walking areas, more prominent than cars so it's safer and promotes active living and socialising."
"Would prefer to keep private vehicles out of the CBD as much as possible, make the CBD a place for pedestrians, socialising, shopping and eating."

"More people, less cars in the central area, street cafes and green spaces."
"I want more car free squares like in european cities, these are great for gathering and relaxing"
"I would like a no cars inner city. Walkways and cycle ways. More parks and plants, benches to rest on and enjoy the city's atmosphere."
"I don't want Cars. The Central City was formerly dominated by cars; busy streets, long wait times for pedestrians and cyclists at traffic lights made getting around annoying at times."
No cars in area bounded by Lichfield / Gloucester / Manchester / river
Pedestrian area from Manchester to Durham and St Asaph to Hereford Streets. Car parks outside these areas.
I want less cars and more emphasis on walking and cycling and public transport. No need to park car in front of shops
"I don't want Lots of cars, as then it just feels busy without feeling vibrant. Too many cars also reduce the amenity of the central city, fumes, noise, clashes with other modes of transport (walking, cycling, buses)."
No cars / fat smelly buses in centre
"Aim for no cars in Central city / less pollution, less noise / preserve access for disabled people"
"I want Easy ways to get around the place as in monorail, a good bus system or trains to cut back traffic and the use of cars."
"Car-free CBD. Park and ride on edges, trams to take people into and around town"
"If cars are allowed in the central city, they should have to go slow."
"Slow traffic in the centre. Mix of cars, cycles and pedestrians at slow speed"
Car park away from centre and have mini shuttles to the centre
"Cars kept out of centre, people only in centre, small buses bring people in from carparking areas"
Could we park our cars in a flat area eg Addington or Sydenham etc. and then hop on a shuttle to the CBD. Drop workers / shoppers off.
no car parking buildings in the centre
"Park and ride keeps cars from central city. Works well in Oxford, UK."
"Not to have car park buildings or so much concrete wasted space, think of a transport system without car park buildings"
I Don't want ugly car parks and carparking buildings. Keep them out of sight.
I want the use of car stackers in buildings instead of car parking buildings. Make good use of space.
Put car parks underground
Good old fashioned feet! Especially if there were covered bits and places to escape the rain.
"Inner city, foot, cycle, electric shuttle buses. To suburbs, bus / rail from Moorhouse station. Create pickup centre for bulky shopping."
A shuttle type public transport system to get into town in less busy times / areas? Avoid shaking our homes when under-utilised buses pass.
"Separate areas for cyclists, look at Copenhagen, where the cycle lane is between the footpath and the bus lane"
Also to include more dedicated cycleways (my Mum won't let me ride my bike to school (St Michaels in the central city) because it's too dangerous) and more attractive buildings.
"I want Separate cycle roads, so you can cycle in complete safety. Safe places to leave bikes. I would love to cycle again but haven't for years as it isn't safe."
"Dedicated cycleway (like Bourke St, Sydney) providing safe cycling without traffic and parked cars. `"
I would like a city where my children can cycle to all parks and city centre while not sharing the roads with cars.
Bigger and more cycle ways from suburbs to city area
"I want Bike lanes from suburbs to city centre, similar to London blue cycle lane and bike hire places for people to use for work or leisure"
"Cycle friendly central City, extending to the suburbs"
"Amsterdam is an example where some central parts are extremely cycle friendly, even down to free cycles to get around"
Communal bikes can be free and kept on buses and central lockers
a cycle system in the inner city of borrow ride and park a bike
I want cycleways and a large walkways to follow route of avon river
Enhanced river banks with walkways cycle ways cafes and seating areas
Love the idea of a cycleway around the river – great tourist potential and lovely for us
"I want cycleways along the river, to encourage cyclists and not cars"
Bike tracks along the river avon all the way along so we don't have to bike on the roads.
"I want bike / walk tracks along the avon river for an activity inn the central city. Lots of small parks and activities for children, and small shops along streets for some tourist attractions."
"Integrate the river, improve walking and cycle routes. Don't treat the river as a drain."
"I want Shared slow zone roads around the square. Deliveries 6-9 am. Only electric shuttles, biking, walking, meeting, sitting"
spaces with shared pedestrian / cycle liked access ways
"I want Shared space; people / walking friendly; accessible spaces for wheelchairs, mobility scooters, prams; dedicated cycle lanes"
"Where practical, cycleways separate from traffic. Shared pedestrian and cyclist footpaths where space is limited."
Better connecting cycleways from outlying suburbs. Inner city lanes are good but you have to be able to get to the city in the first place!
"Central facility for cyclists providing secure storage, showers, towel, locker etc.. Like Brisbane's Cycle2City, accessed via membership"
Secure places to park and lock bicycles with shower facilities. Obviously it would need to be a user pays arrangement
We need bike parks where we can leave bikes parked safely. Cycle lanes are fantastic as well!
"Secure areas to park your bike while you head off to the shops or out for lunch, somewhere in view and with surveillance for security."
Cycleways separated from the road and dedicated signals at busy intersections such as the ones at Kilmarnock street into the park
Bikes that people can rent at stations throughout the central city (like they did for scape but on a larger scale) also great for tourists
"Free, frequent public transport (trams?) around the city centre to avoid congestion, cycle-friendly, vibrant and pedestrian-centric!"
A free Park n Ride car park out of central CBD with access to free Shuttle and Tramway
Build car parks at corners of 4 avenues with free shuttle buses in to centre-keep central city free of non-essential traffic-clean / green

Easy access to and around the central city. Integrated transport systems that make it easy to get from the suburbs to the CBD
"Safe and easy ways to get to town so that we all come and use the new, amazing central city. I want to feel that the kids are safe cycling in to town."
A great city centre is a centre that is easy to get to and to get around in.
"An easy transport system. Fast train / tram / monorail something to connect the city centre with the suburbs, the Hospital, the Airport, the sea, university and shopping malls – buses just clog up the already clogged up roads"
"Make the CBD an easy place for all to access for shopping and recreation, effective public transport, accessible linkages between spaces and places"
"Transportation that is easy to jump on and jump off at your destination ie, tram, Cars are a hazard in the city and are a difficult form of transport to navigate your way around the city centre. Being able to get to where you want or jump off when something catches your eye may encourage more to venture into the city, it would me."
"Some form of one way system to be retained. It means for me that is easy to access the CBD. Without a convenient and efficient way to enter and exit the central city I am less inclined to go there. Also, if the existing system of getting across town is taken away, there needs to be a alternative put in place otherwise the traffic woes we have put up with after the quake will continue!"
"No one way streets through the central city. Our central city should aim to exist for people, not cars."
"Cars give way to bikes, turning islands where cars wait, slow cars to 30kmh, no car parks on streets, raised car entrances / exits."
Lower speed limits (and streets to match it) in central city to give more parity to pedestrians and cyclists
"Keep the one way streets. Make the areas inside the one way streets pedestrian only. Keep trams running. Block centre median into CBD at 4 avenues except for one way streets. Allow left-in, left-out from 4 avenues in to CBD for non one way streets."
Encourage use of walkways and bicycle lanes by getting rid of one way system. Restrict vehicle access to central city. Use electric shuttles.
"Reduce the one way system to one circular route, Montreal, Salisbury, Barbados and St Asaph Streets and make the area inside these car-less."
"I would love to see the inner city car free with a lot of cycle ways, bus lanes and pedestrian only areas."
"more green & memorial in square. Mix entertainment, business, cafes, bars together. No cars within avenues."
A central ring road around the CBD with parking building / space off the ring road and direct routes to the ring road.
Cycleways separated from the road and dedicated signals at busy intersections such as the ones at Kilmarnock street into the park.
"That's a good idea! Especially when the inner city gets more restricted for cars, more pedestrian only areas!"
"Good idea, with public transport and cycle lanes taking people into centre, good parking options on outside of ring road etc"
A tree-lined ring road would be a great idea. Restrict access to cbd and include access off ring road to park & ride facilities into cbd
"Whatever plan is selected the new city MUST be fully accessible to people with all types of impairments including those with mobility problems, the elderly, the blind and the deaf. This includes buildings, roads & footpaths, transport, parks & recreational facilities."
In many towns and cities in England there is now a shopmobility service. This has a small fleet of electric scooters at big car parks that can be hired for a modest charge. The shoppers leave their cars in the car park and tour the shops or visit a restaurant on a hired scooter.
"30km / h speed limit within the central CBD, as was planned by the Council 7 years ago but never implemented"
I would like to see safety of pedestrians and walkers looked at. At times dangerous as cyclists and skateboarders try to use the same space. Maybe leave road space for cars and express bus lanes but divide footpath
"No cars, no buses in small areas e.g., the Square, Central Mall."
"Make the square our piazza. No cars. A beautiful fountain with quality cafes and shops, and more security"
"Discourage cars from the St Asaph St, Madras St, Rolleston Ave, Salisbury St area. Make this area pedestrian & bike friendly."
no cars inside armagh to litchfield manchester to river after 9 am to 4 pm daily only bikes mini cabs mini buses.
"Central streets (hereford, manchester, etc) closed at night to cars, to create a better atmosphere and night life for the city."
More pedestrianised areas through the centre. Colombo street should have car restrictions at certain times.
Block off some of the city centre to cars. So tourists can walk around and see Christchurch.
Make the entire centre a pedestrian area. No cars just free trams :)
we should have 2 bus stations and have trams regularly going between the 2 of them. keep the city traffic down no buses in the city centre.
keep big busses out of centre by creating outer boundary transfers with mini busses only entering cbd
No buses to be in the central city. They are dirty and not energy friendly.
"No buses in the city centre. Yes, light trams in regular intervals. Move bus exchange to out of the city centre old women's hospital site?"
"maintain a central bus exchange, but remove inner city services in exchange for tram, walking and bike ways."
A green pedestrian / cycle only centre with hop-on-off tram transport to perimeter car parking.
Most buses should terminate and cars should be left in parking areas on outer edge of CBD. Keep the central area for pedestrians.
"Put 24-7 car parks (& good shuttle bus service) at EDGE of CBD near arterial routes, rather than have to drive through congestion to park."
Possibly car parking just out of the very centre of the city with shuttles leaving and taking people into the central city and returning to the car parks so all that traffic is not in the heart of our city.
Slow traffic zone between square and botanic gardens without one ways (Montreal and Cambridge Terrace)
Manufacturing industry brings traffic and waste disposal issues. Not appropriate in central city.
Keep the city centre free of industrial businesses-reduce heavy vehicles use in the CBD.
I want More green space integrated with stormwater treatment systems (the Avon River currently receives vast amounts of untreated stormwater filled with various contaminants).
"When re-paving an area, channel stormwater to a rain garden or a swale not into a stormwater pipe. This improves water quality in rivers."
"Green spaces have long been seen as important in reducing storm water runoff. A combination of more ground-level parks and rooftop gardens can reduce the strain on sewers and reduce the burden placed on water-treatment facilities (Johnston & Newton, 2004), particularly important considering the damage caused by the recent earthquakes. They can also help keep pollutants such as cadmium, copper, lead and nitrates from entering the groundwater."
"Surface Water Management WANTED It is essential that naturalistic methods are utilised to manage the quality and quantity of surface water. That is, porous and vegetated ground surfaces, green roofs, swales and rain gardens, spring flows flowing on a daylit surface (not piped), wetlands adjoining the river corridor."
Redesigned storm water systems that don't run into city rivers. New waste systems with separate grey / brown water allowing grey water reuse
Celebrate the fact we have the worlds best water. More fountains and drinking fountains on streets and in parks and ban bottled water.
Category : Electrical Reticulation. Underground electrical lines are very nice but not practical in earthquake areas. All lines above ground
"Take the opportunity on any road that is dug up to repair services to ensure that all utilities (phone, power, cable TV) are placed underground"
I would like to see satellite sewage works around the city rather than all the waste going to Bromley. Why would we continue to send all the waste to an area that has had severe damage and liquefaction problems. Many smaller works would mean less pipes at risk and people would realise its their problem. These have been used at many other places around NZ and the world and can be made very environmentally friendly.
"Not just central but all over, flexible pipes for water / drains / sewers so they won't break every time there's a shake"
"I Don't want dark spaces, traffic jams, rubbish pollution, noise, nightclubs"
"Tidy green spaces, more rubbish bins, hire more people to clean up the streets."
Install the 3 bin recycle system on the CBD streets in the parks etc..
Design areas around buildings to encourage recycling. Discreetly screen rubbish / recycling bins. Use artistic designs for bins. Be bold.
High-rise buildings to allow reasonable population density
Be realistic about needing high rises to have enough density for vibrant city.
Stop urban sprawl by moving to a medium density city model
"Keep the city compact. The more compact it is the more vibrant it will be, don't fear hi-density, but demand high quality"
inner city vibrancy-this means inner city living and socializing. Higher density housing than what we had pre-quakes. It gives chch soul
Lots of high density residential in the inner city so there are always enough people around to sustain the cafes etc that people want to see
Social sustainability of Christchurch must take into account addressing the need for high urban density in an attractive site that will attract residents and businesses
Large amounts of medium density housing
High population density
"High density low rise living with integrated community retail, cafes, pubs"
"Low rise building medium density, markets"
Minimum of two story buildings to promote higher density living in the CBD
"Parisian / London style high density low rise buildings with integrated retail, restaurants, pubs, offices."
"I want small compact CBD, higher density low rise quarters."
"I would not want to see a high-density population in Christchurch, eg like apartment blocks / high density villages with village greens '."
"Housing, Do not want to see multi storey housing, Research has identified people living on top of each other causes conflict amongst neighbours"
"Safe (low rise, low density)"
All great cities have a mix of residential and commercial in at their heart
"Low rise, mixed use office / residential / retail / movie theatres / cafes."
"Agree specialist boutique type shops scattered amongst cafes, restaurants and bars"
mixed use inner city development mixing residences with businesses and other facilities / amenities. An inner city to live in and not just to visit.
"a good mix of leisure, learning, living & commerce."
"Mix of business, lots of diversity, assimilated rather than Lawyer Lane, Café Boulevard '."
Food / culture / art in among businesses
"All shops together, makes it dead at night. All restaurants and bars together makes it dead in the morning"
"Truly vibrant cities have a great mix of high end of funky retail cafes apartments, night life mix it up!"
"Mixed use development is KEY. Shops, cafes, etc on the ground floor, nice flats above. Once people live in the city, it will become better."
"To be a hub for culture, shopping, eating / socialising with good inner city living apartments. Business e.g., lawyers, accountants, etc.."
Mix of business and residential to bring back heart and soul to the CBD.
"A good mix of retail, business, culture and entertainment to encourage people of all ages or interests to participate and have a sense of belonging there."
A good mix of business and nature and leisure and entertainment. Not so many businesses but more variety
"It should be strikingly different to the existing suburban shopping malls, an interesting mix of residential, commercial, business & cultural"
"Control development within heart to maintain a mix of residential, offices, retail, galleries, cafes, entertainment, cultural facilities & tourist accommodation etc.."
"Music, Culture, Business, Art, Chinatown"
"I want diverse business, IT, finance, retail, hospitality, creating a diverse workforce. This diversity creates vibrancy and a sense of inclusiveness for visitors"
"A greater mix of uses, e.g buildings with retail, offices and living together."
"Mixed commercial, residential and retail buildings."
"Mixed use buildings, residential, retail, commercial like Europe"
build rest homes on the upper levels like Europe so the elderly can enjoy & be part of the City
"Businesses downstairs, offices above, residential above that. Density but lower rise"
"Specialist shops – the type that there were only a few of in the whole of Christchurch. E.g. Knitworld, Scorpio, Fazazz, Longhorn leather."
We miss being able to walk around the streets and walk into shops that have individuality and not the same old same.
Specialist shops that only had one store that was / is inside the cordon.
More boutique stores for individual orders
"boutique shops, no malls or chain shops."
"Access to specialist shops such as shoe repairer, outdoor clothing specialist."
"Shops need to be predominantly boutique, unique upmarket fashion, speciality arts etc.."
Boutique shops not large retail chains / malls.
Focus on cafes and bars in the rebuild as a point of difference from the suburban malls.
less souvenir shops and more high street and one off businesses to show nz and locally made products to New Zealanders and tourists
want pedestrian malls with a wide variety of shopping and cultural activities
car-free shopping streets
Open pedestrian malls (like New Regent street)
pedestrians mall with seating
I would like to maintain a pedestrian only city mall.
I would love to see a pedestrian mall with lots of shops and cafes.
Possibly Colombo could be pedestrian mall from Lichfield through to Gloucester or Armagh.
No traffic pedestrian mall in core of CBD.
More pedestrian only shopping streets and street markets would be great
"More covered ways between malls (Cashel, High St etc)"
covered shopping zones
covered walkways for rainy days
use walkways that are covered (and strong!)
covered walkways for pedestrians.
Covered walkways 4 shelter
Covered walkways link shops / offices.
Enclose Cashel Mall with a glass roof / canopy. (like Fremont Street in Las Vegas). Have the entrance and exit open allowing air to flow through. A clear roof allows sunshine through on a sunny day and keeps the rain out on a winters day.
covered ways with disability scooter access.
is an experience and should be considered a something that would involve 4 hours at least not 1 hour mad dash in and out.
"I want Reasons to spend time in the city, farmers markets, the arts, clubs and bars, buskers, street life, restaurants, organised open entry concerts, museums, heritage, boutique shopping"
I don't want rubbish shops on the high street selling stuff that won't last a week
I don't want shops that you can find everywhere else.
I don't want stupid pointless shops like two dollar stores and value mart
"There should be none of the scummy sex shops, $2 shops, tacky touristy shops."
I don't want Porn shops and crappy cheap traders a la lower Colombo & Tuam
I don't want Cheap $2 type junk shops
the Dux de Lux atmosphere.
"Local specialty shopping. Ballantynes, McKenzie and Willis, De Spa chocolate shop!"
Cultural activities; shopping in town – Ballantynes.
"Boutique shops, Ballantynes, art gallery, new regent street, cafes and restaurants, movie theatres."
I've missed going to Ballantynes and other shops that you can't get anywhere else. I've missed all my favourite cafes and restaurants.
Affordable rent for the little guys so we keep the quirky shops alive. Not just the big franchises.
Work with bldg owners so that rents are not too high for the kind of boutique shops we need in town
new retail shops need to be modest with rents and rates to match
"Small businesses, interesting, lively. Need a decent percentage of lower rentals to be talked about now that the bad old cheap buildings are gone."
I want cheap rental properties to encourage people with talents ie artists / potters / boutiques
Subsidise rent for small unique food shops to encourage variety
"Keep rates / rentals low encourage boutique, specialist, hobby, startup businesses."
"Ask ourselves why are the malls full of people. Don't replicate them but follow their principles of free parking, convenience, ability to go to no matter what the weather."
No big malls
Malls are cathedrals of consumption.
I don't want Big Malls. I 'm not a big fan of them and I much rather stroll along boutiques than get horded around a big mall. They all appear the same.
I don't want big mega stores. Keep these to the suburbs and specially designated zones.
shops and buildings with their own style and character (unlike the malls)
I don't think we should have any big shopping malls in the CBD. Shopping malls in other cities usually strip the streets of shops.
Small boutique businesses are better than big malls
No mall type developments.
I don't want Westfield!!! and its ilk.
Don't allow the spread of any more malls.
No big malls but streets interlinked with boutique stores as well as some of the bigger stores.
CHC people shop at malls. San Diego and Honolulu have revitalised CDB with outdoor malls.
There should be a big mall in the cbd so everyone from around the world will want to come shop in Christchurch and have al the big brands and names in this but make it only 2 or 3 storeys high. it should a couple of blocks wide though
"shopping mall in inner city, people like malls. Get over that you CCC planners!"
Have shops open later e.g. 10 am to 10 pm
We should encourage the CBD to open later and stay open later as most European cities do. I believe our CBD should open at 10.00 or 11.00 am and stay open till 8.00 pm. Our CBD needs to set itself up as something different from the suburban offering. Office and other workers in the suburbs who finish work at 5.30 or 6.00 pm have little chance of any CBD retail experience. If the City opened later and stayed open till 8.00 pm then we would find workers come to town in the evening as a family to do retail shopping and then stay on for a meal or to catch up with friends in the evening. The city would create its own evening character and life like we see overseas.
Longer Retail hours up to 10 pm.
"Would love a small supermarket (similar to UK's Tesco Metro / Sainsbury's), not the overpriced convenience stores that we've had in the past"
Auckland & Wellington already have metro version supermarkets. Encourage the big two supermarket owners to bring them to Chch.
"Micro Supermarkets like Woolworths Metro or Coles Express that sell fresh food and all products, not the overpriced 7-11 etc"
A compact metro version of supermarket
24/7 mini-supermarket
inner city supermarkets with good food
"I want one supermarket, convenient to do shopping while having a good time in the inner city"
Regular access to favourite businesses and services.
Character shops.
look after small businesses.
I don't want Sleazy down market shops and activities
"Our city was in some ways broken before the earthquakes, too fragmented, grey and whole pockets of dilapidated structures housing dubious operations that were an embarrassment really. Not sad to see them go actually. Our city was in some ways broken before the earthquakes, too fragmented, grey and whole pockets of dilapidated structures housing dubious operations that were an embarrassment really. Not sad to see them go actually."
No Adult Shops
Get rid of the Massage Parlours
Get rid of the sex shops in main street.
No Manchester Street or shifty brothels
No XXXX stores. No legal high shops.
I don't want adult / sex shops on Colombo St!!!!!
"Ditch the massage parlours, brothels etc!"
Get rid of the party pill shops!
I want less souvenir shops and more high street and one off businesses to show nz and locally made products to new zealanders and tourists.
Also less souvenir shops they're ugly and silly
"no $2 shops, no sex shops"
"I don't want tattoo parlours, party pill shops, $2 shops, adult shops, stand alone liquor shops"
"I don't want low level shops such as two dollar shops, sex shops and other shops that are not of value."
"Low rise in CBD, Cafes and retail on ground, residential and office above."
"Cafes, bars, shopping markets, entertainment, to create a buzzing environment."
Lots of small eateries or cafes to service inner city hotels and shoppers
lots of cafes.
Wider pavements to allow cafes to seat outside.
"specialist boutique type shops scattered amongst cafes, restaurants and bars with lots of casual seating amongst plants gardens lawns"
more indoor / outdoor cafes.
wider pedestrian paths with native plantings and outdoor vista for cafes.
Outside cafes.
"More green grass, cafes that spill out onto the footpath. More pedestrian only roads"
openair cafes.
Cafes etc on the nth-sth streets for shelter and sun.
I want a sensible closing time for bars and clubs (not 5 am)
"Close bars before midnight, people will not live in CBD if it is full of drunks and noise at night"
Keep bars and clubs open but monitor alcohol abuse
"Revision of liquor licensing regulations to extend closed door policies to all licensed premises within the CBD and reduce drinking hours, ideally having all premises close at 2 am and at minimum, with no new customers entering after 2 am"
I want lots of bars and pubs. Night life. Something to do for 24 hours a day!
I think the clubs should be more classy and that lock down should be well and truly after 3 am. I don't think there should be a lock down. overseas they don't have lock downs like we do here.
"emphasize a diversity of smaller cafes / wine bars / eateries. Create a pro social environment, get rid of booze barns"
"Create an amphitheatre for the community, outdoor cinema, plays and theatricals!"
I want small cinemas.
drive-in cinema
"Gardens, cinemas, restaurants, beer-gardens, music venues and galleries."
The smaller cinemas outside the major movie chains.
Small independent cinemas.
Art house movie theatres
"I want movie theatres to bring more people in to the inner city who can combine other entertainment with a night at the movies, dinner, shopping, etc"
"restrict shops that close at 5, so that the city remains vibrant throughout the evenings."
allow for a vibrant & safe night life
"I also think that the city nightlife needs to be improved. I think the clubs should be more classy. I think there should be nice pretty lights on the streets and when your walking through town, there should be no streets that are pitch black and make you feel unsafe. I think there should be more security cameras around for peoples safety."
"A better nightlife, decent restaurants, bars and night time shopping e.g. night markets with nz handicrafts. This will attract tourists because there's not many exciting things to do at night if you are visiting Christchurch."
"Develop a boutique shopping hub in Cashel Mall. No big mall style shops (eg Glassons). Great opportunity to have a buzzy, vibrant hub!"
Upper high street stores need to be brought closer to cashel mall.
Cover Cashel Mall to allow all year round entertainment
Re-open the Dux De Lux
I want the Dux de Lux back
Please open the Dux de Lux now.
The Dux De Lux reinstated.
Dux de Lux-facilitate speedy repair.
Wide streets and footpaths and alleyways full of interesting businesses
"Integrate some vehicle free, meandering cobbled laneways with botique shops and cafes, like the lanes near Flinders Station, Melbourne"
"Make more of the lane idea, and mix in the feel of grand arcades, with smaller retail, cafe, bars."
"keep the quirky feel to the city, keep the lanes that have vibrant shops that stock one off items, so we can support locals"
"I don't want fast food outlets close together, causes teenagers to hang around and creates problems, e.g. graffiti, fighting"
don't want Fast food outlets that neighbour each other. eg KFC on one side and McDonalds directly opposite. Young people congregate there and their presence intimidates others '
don't want.Groups of fast food restaurants which attract litter and loitering
Not a single chain store for unhealthy food
I don't want KFC McDonalds and Burger King etc
here should be no fast food outlets.
"I don't want fast food outlets they make a lot of mess and attract groups of people who have not a lot of consideration for other people, ie leave there mess on the roads footpaths etc also group together taking up the whole pavement so people have to wind there way through and feel quite intimidated"
I don't want fast food franchises
"Ethnic enclaves eg Chinatown, Little India, Italian quarter for eating and entertainment"
I want Chinatown. Every great city has one
Would like to see a Chinatown concept developed for Asian restaurants
ethnic districts.
I want ethnic food restaurants in the city
buildings where cafes and restaurants are ground level and businesses on the second level.
"Banks, insurance companies etc should have minimal street frontage, keep the street alive by have varied businesses that add vitality."
"I don't want buildings that become deserted in the evening, e.g., admin buildings ONLY (banks, insurance)"
don't want a dominance of commercial and retail businesses that excludes or marginalises normal living and social interaction
"Significantly reduce the number of professional offices and relocate in nearby suburbs, sydenham, addington"
"In order to encourage businesses back Government Departments, Ecan and CCC offices should all be returned as quickly as possible"
"I'd like to see the government make a bold first step, The IRD building has survived well. I'd like to see other government departments located near it, a sort of government hub"
Have other government departments located in a government hub around the IRD building ie have the government lead the charge of investing in the city.
"I want services such as banks and government departments, clusters of dentists and lawyers"
"I want life and that means activities that bring it such as arts and concerts. students, eg music and commerce students. professional life such as lawyers and accountants and engineers need to be congregated there as well."
a mix of office / shops / urban apartments
Premises of a scale and diversity that allow a variety of small businesses to thrive.
Strong commercial hub must be the core of any future CBD-by definition.
I don't want to see a city based just on business and economics as this will not be a step forward for the future.
Less commercial inside the CBD or more apartments.
"Mixed retail, residential cultural and commercial"
"Residential and commercial activities need to be accommodated in the same building, shops and commercial on ground floor with floors of apartments living above."
I want a mix of business and homes.
"The CBD as a hub for bars, business, restaurants, accom & entertainment. If CHCH activity is less sprawled growth will come naturally."
"Parts of the University campus come to the city, how about the arts people, get it buzzing with energetic young arty people."
"Bring back the University, this will bring vibrancy and people back."
Bring university back! Lots of vibrant young people.
"move Canterbury University back into town, a steady, large population of students and staff to support cbd business"
Bring as many campus institutes back to the CBD as you can. Having students studying in the city gives it life.
We really have to be positive about bringing the whole university back into town. The benefits far outway the effort involved to shift.
"No university in the city, it is nice where it is."
Keep university at Ilam – Do not attempt to fix what isn't broken!
UC has a billion invested in infrastructure at Ilam. It would have to have a spectacular financial inducement to shift into the city.
I want I personally think having parts of the University in town is a waste of learning time through travel. I've spent 4 years at University and you don't want to be travelling to different campus '.
"the university should not be in the city. What a waste of the Ilam campus. Bring it into the city with displays, events, presentations, one off occasions."
schools because we have to cater for future generations
more schools
"Bring back schools like Unlimited and Discovery, innovative education."
"Good primary, secondary and tertiary schools."
High quality primary and secondary schools in the inner city would attract families to live there.
Fantastic schools at all levels to attract families and young people.
I don't want schools as encourage large groups of kids to hang about the city. Were quite intimidating.
Public library incorporate a café.
Large public library.
a big Library.
I. liked the idea of linking the new university with a tram / town link.
Having a separate children's library with a cafe and playground.
I want more swimming pools because more kids can get interested and learn how to swim.
I want more 50 metre swimming pools. because there are no pools at the moment
"It is important for the future of Christchurch that tourism should continue to be encouraged. Therefore, we need low rise hotels, restaurants, cafes and bars and good shopping opportunities, particularly of New Zealand products. Entertainment is also important and I would love to see new theatres, artist studios and such like being a part of the new concept."
Hotels (2-3 storey low-rise) along the riverside with balcony restaurants for tourists. Punters & kayakers can stop in too for a lunch meal.
"the many hotels and backpackers are great for encouraging a vibrant night scene, any night of the week."
I want a variety of more modern buildings and interesting tourist attractions for exciting nights out with fine dining and luxury hotels.
"I have been involved in a managerial role for 38 years. In provincial and International Cricket and it is often commented by not only local cricketers, but by players from all over the world how much they like being in the inner city hotels enjoying the various city night life. (P.S. think of paris when deciding on the height of new build)."
Give tourist a reason to come and see us
A vibrant city where people want to live is one which attracts tourists. A town designed for tourists make residents go to malls.
"It is important for Christchurch future that Tourism should be encouraged, therefore we need low rise hotels, Restaurants, Cafés, bars and good shopping opportunities, particularly of Art Galleries and theatres. A wide range of Businesses must be encouraged established with cheap shops, these are readily accessed in most shopping malls. New Regent Street was part of our Heritage with its great atmosphere and range of shops and it would be great to see it rebuilt."
Accommodation from backpackers to more affluent.
"Accommodation, all levels, backpackers to luxury."
"Visitor accommodation. Five star, three and four star bed and breakfasts, backpacker hostels."
"Industry tends to be 8, 4.30 5 or 5.5 days a week. Need 24 hour / 7day life in CBD."
"factories [ which use smoke ], stinky smells"
The visual aspect. Mostly the premises occupied by these businesses are not visually appealing.
"Industrial business generates heavy traffic, noise and pollution which should be kept to the CBD periphery. Only office based business in CBD."
"Industrial firms often noisy, smelly and hazardous plus high heavy traffic count for delivery on and off site Keep them out."
"Don't like the look of them, or the heavy traffic they generate"
Are usually ugly looking buildings that don't feel safe around them at night.
"Architecture, footprint, landscaping are crucial for SMALL scale non polluting industries in CBD."
"Light industrial (e.g. electronics, software) can get people into the city without adding noise or pollution."
Melbourne style restaurant district
"Create precincts of similar activity eg.. Victoria St, Specialist Gifts & Artisan Foods, High Street – Fashion"
"Having a clearly defined shopping quarter, with beautifully presented shops, and the same again for restaurants and eateries."
Create unique cultural / ethnic precincts within the CBD that provide unique shopping and eating experiences for locals and tourists alike.
Boutique shopping avenues like High St was as they provide a certain flavour to the city.
High St and SOL were very special
a retail hub like high St again.
fashion shops à la High St.
"Better flow between shops, eateries, town hall, libraries, theatres and galleries. LINK IT TOGETHER."
"Utilise tram tracks to connect precincts together, make them suitable for all to use, not just tourists. Include them in metro card system and extend tracks to suburbs eg Addington and Riccarton"
"Cohesive public transport and cycle lanes. that work in harmony with pedestrian walkways, safe for all."
linking lanes between precincts to encourage movement which means healthier residents also
"Free public transport amongst precincts once in CBD e.g. Trams, monorail"
Remove some of the streets to enable better linking of ‘ precincts '.
"confine adult shops to a small precinct, a red light district, not throughout the city"
Take the ‘ Garden City to another level so that it's beautiful and that is exactly what Christchurch is known for.
"We already have been awarded the Garden City lets build on that. It is aesthetically pleasing. Great for health; citizens and for tourists. Every building to have a garden maybe small but easy on the eye and breaks up the concrete appearance. October in Christchurch is wonderful with the blossoms etc, maybe a future tourist opportunity, i.e. visit now."
REMEMBER our name.THE GARDEN CITY
make Christchurch more of the Garden City '
"I would like to see Christchurch following its garden city tag and become a show case of low impact living, roof top gardens etc.."
"Enhance the clean, green, garden city image."
Continue with our garden city image
Christchurch is the Garden City let it be a 21st century version relevant to Global pressures.
Support the innovative and inspiring Greening the Rubble and Gap Filler projects. The Asko site sets a great example.
Landscape all demolition sites immediately so that they look like a dressed wound rather than an open sore
no turning empty lots into carparks for years. Either rebuild or green up. Pop up gardens.
"Welcome people back to the city with a Sunday Parkway : a street circuit closed to motor traffic for walk / bike / etc & markets, festival, fun!"
"I propose the use of shipping container architecture, for fast, strong, light, modular rebuilding, with maximum room for creative design to meet community requirements. As shipping containers are weather proof by nature, buildings can be occupied and used as soon as interior fit out is completed, hastening a return to business as usual in the CBD, even whilst the exterior is unfinished."
Indoor Markets are located in various overseas cities and would form an attraction / destination for both locals and tourists.
Create inner city open markets to draw the local community back in the short term
"The period of rebuilding should have a fun component to look back on eg temporary artworks, giant ludo boards, labyrinths; not bomb sites."
"Quirky installations while we wait for the rebuild, to make us smile again"
Tactical Urbanism Strategies; Pop up shops and cafes in vacant sites.
"Tactical urbanism – initiated as soon as possible, with no red tape (play streets, pop up shops, pop up cafes, chair bombing – new tactical urbanism Sarah Goodyear www.grist.org/urbanism/tactical, mobile vendors, temporary pop up experiments)"
"A free amphitheatre for shows for children and the Buskers Festival, surround it with retail and apartments and GARDEN!"
Public stages
Need an outside amphitheatre for carols by candlelight etc
"An amphitheatre to display music, buskers etc"
an amphitheatre feel for concerts
"Small outdoor amphitheatre, street theatre / musicians."
A mini amphitheatre for live performers.
an amphitheatre where there could be different entertainment and displays can be seen on a regular basis.
"Outdoor amphitheatre for theatre, speakers, entertainers."
sculpture gardens.
More sculptures around city.
"I want loads of sculptures, because they are nice."
Lots of greenscape esp trees and gardens Sitting corners. Sculptures.
More outdoor sculptures

sculptures & cool things like that.
"love to see art and sculptures around the city, more culture"
More art and sculpture in amongst buildings
"Social Ports, seating."
Outdoor seating for having lunch etc
plenty of seating.
A children's playground for young children should be included and some outdoor facility for older children close by.
a big playground with a climbing wall. The climbing wall needs to start off easy and get harder.
"Emphasis on New Zealand culture rather than English, more native trees and cultural attractions."
Christchurch's heritage includes exotic plantings.
English style trees to reflect our English Heritage and Native trees as well to help encourage birds to return.
More New Zealand native trees rather than English.
"Remember this is an English city, so don't get carried away with things Maori, most the population have British roots, including the majority of Maori. So please replant with exotic trees and don't do the ugly PC thing of only planting natives, you can have that in all the rest of NZ, but Chch is known for its Englishness, and remember the hard-working founders who came with ideals they tried to honour."
Offer low rise living with roof gardens and underground parking.
At lunch breaks etc. those that worked in the city could make their way out into the roof top gardens kick back and relax away from the busy noisy environment of day to day life at the street level.
"The most remarkable thing about an aerial shot of any city is what a great wasteland the rooftops really are. all being perfectly good real estate, but virtually unusable because they are isolated from, and at a different height to, their neighbours. But there is no real reason why roofs can not be connected at a higher level, and used to form a more or less level virtual ground plane."
"Carparking below at ground and underground level, and plaza or rooftop garden above. Gives both parking and greenspace in same footprint."
roof top gardens and green walls. a living eco system of a city abounding with bellbirds and woodpigeons. flow the botanic gardens into city

I want loads of roof top gardens!
I want interactive water fountains

Fruit & vege markets in CBD and inner suburbs. Lots of fresh produce (like Melbourne markets. Vic market & south Melbourne market).
"Farmers Market : A large two level indoor market selling produce, (cheeses, chocolates, fruit and vegetables, etc) and high quality takeaway foods (cakes, meals, etc) with café, etc.. Along lines of Adelaide Market."
"A large undercover market like la boquera in Barcelona. It has fish, meat, fruit and vegetables, cafes, bars and every colour and noise possible."
Farmers Markets to increase the availability of quality fresh produce.
I want Farmers market large enough to bring down prices of vegetables governed by supermarkets.
"Canterbury produces some of the best food in New Zealand (I just helped judge the farmers markets NZ awards, it's totally true!) , and this reputation should be nurtured. Making it easier for anyone to set up a stall, either once-off or on a semi-regular basis, gives the city a more diverse food culture."
"A quality undercover food market with different experience wings e.g. South wing fresh local meat, fish, fruit and veg"
"I want a permanent ethnic market, a la Chinatown."
With such a multicultural population and strong Asian community a Chinas town could work well here and bring people into the city.

Some CBD streets pedestrian only with beautification added in
pedestrian zones
plenty of pedestrian only streets.
"I'd like Christchurch to be seen as the best city on the planet to be a cyclist. From recreational cycling to cycling to work, the streets layout should be totally accessible for bikes, rickshaws or any other non-car / truck transport."
"The cycle lanes should be interlinked and should include the airport. Secure cycle storage would be an excellent idea, ideally lock-up sheds with card access. These sheds should be distributed around the city, including the airport and the bus interchange. I would pay for this facility-say $1 a time for using the sheds?"
"Plenty of covered cycle stands, especially outside the gyms (not just rings which hold only two cycles like there were in the city."
Christchurch is NOT Amsterdam. Don't make it into a pedestrian / cycle only city.
"people only streets ', where it's like a giant footpath with cafes and little shops on either side. no cars disturbing!"
Closed off streets with cycle ways with shops and cafes
Wide footpaths with trees and other plants.

Shops would all be set back from the road.
Upper storeys of buildings set back – for safety and sun.
making our gardens even better and including more art
"I plead for the rebuild of Christchurch to ensure that it is a truly wheelchair-friendly city. This includes the need for well-maintained, level paths, the access to street crossings to be very smooth, and not have bumps (which currently regularly damage my wheelchair). Please understand that saying somewhere is wheelchair-accessible, then facing the user with heavy doors to open, makes a lie of the first statement! Please install automatic doors."
"Shaded and rain-protected walkways, dismantle heavy walkway overhands : dangerous, not pleasant looking, replace with lightweight tensile structures (sail shades)"
streetscape and building design to also reflect and protect from our often abysmal climate.
CBD needs plenty of trees to mitigate against the killer easterly wind.
No streets are easterly wind tunnels.
Canopies like they have outside Britomart.
High level canopies providing both shelter from rain and cross-bracing between buildings.
Use lightweight materials for canopies
Canopies to protect us from the sun.
All pedestrian ways to have covered awnings.

"Lots of lighting, create funky streetlamps unique to Chch."
"Wider streets, tree lined"
"a beautiful wide boulevard with dedicated cycle ways, trees."

Parkland and cycle ways along both sides of the Avon.
"replace riverside two-lane roads with walkways, cycle-ways and slow one-way roads"
"Benches, tables along the Avon to sit at."
maximise the physical beauty e.g. the Avon.
Open up covered waterways. Make green walks beside them.
Enhance our little Avon – can we uncover a few of the tributaries?
If appropriate some of the former surface waterways that have long been piped should be daylighted and restored to a more natural state.

Policy for good tasteful signage not the visual pollution we have now. No billboards.
I don't want billboards. Truly beautiful cities around the world don't accost you with advertising everywhere you look.
Avoid visual pollution created by cheap loud signage.
Better typography in the CBD! Have all store signs pass a design quality check.
I Don't want cluttered and loud and bright signage.
great opportunity to restrict garish signage and create new regulations encouraging well designed and minimal signs.
"Need better street signage. More obvious when a street is one way or not. Street signs and road work signs need to be bigger, or visually easier for all ages."
More high-quality pedestrian (and cycle) navigation signage around town.
I want colour coded signs for direction
It is an easy city to navigate and get around
Signposts above intersections (same as America) so street name can be seen clearly.
Bilingual signs teach our people our national language and visitors to the city.
I want more Bi-cultural activities e.g. street signs in Te Reo and English.
"It would be great to see more Bilingual signage around the city, reflecting our connections to Ngai Tahu / takata whenua."
All signage in Maori and English.
"Kia ora, This is a great opportunity for CHCH to overcome its conservative image and acknowledge the cultural heritage of Maori in Christchurch as tangata whenua. I strongly recommend signage in te reo Maori, bilingual signage that shows how we honour past and present in CHCH."
"Kia ora, I would be very keen to have bi-lingual signage as part of the new and revitalised Christchurch."
"What's the obsession with Maori signage? Include it, yes, but what about Asian languages for all our visitors too? Makes them more welcome."
"We could be the first city in NZ to have bilingual signage in English and Maori! Would nt take much to do, but the impact would be awesome!"
Get rid of Billboards.
Please put a break on those monstrous bill boards.
I Don't want no ugly large broken billboards please. They make the city look tired and shabby.
I want control of advertising signs and neon lights on buildings so that they harmonise with the buildings
I want self help What to do in Christchurch information terminals
"safe, well tended public toilets."
"lots of public toilets, accessible at night as well"
"toilets open longer, useable in the evening."
"Easier access to public toilets, currently puts me off coming in with the kids"
Good restrooms – more consideration for women with babies
"I want toilets at regular intervals, clean ones safe ones, not automated singing ones."
Composting public toilets with tiger worms – its not as messy as one would think nor as smelly because we can use the by product to feed our Garden City
collect rain water for toilet use
"Some funky toilets, like hundertwasser at Kawakawa would be great too."
More public toilets : try Geraldine or Kawakawa for examples
Plenty of public toilets on ground floor [ will bring ] more people
"Carparks, these should be on the outskirts of the CBD."
Cheap parking on outskirts so it's affordable to come to CHCH more often
Small accessible parking hubs are the way to go.
"free car parking – with free shuttle, tram or monorail into the city."
Keep the free 2 hour parking in the city to encourage people to come back.
Free parking-will make people want to spend more time and money in our city.
free parking
"Abundant parking, free for the first 3 hours, with easy access to shops."
Free parking in the CC parking buildings after 6 pm
Free Parking! Free for the first 2 hours. That's the only way to compete with suburban malls.
carpark buildings open till late but lots of them free too or people will go to the malls
Free too (or people will go to malls).
"More carparking, that doesn't cost so much, very off putting when mall parking is free."
"Unfortunately, without adequate parking, I would shop elsewhere. Need to be realistic. Without parking CBD will never compete with the malls"
Parking is very limited in town and traffic congestion makes roads difficult and dangerous to cross when shopping. Malls are better for both
No parking on the streets for off main road routes
Less on street parking
Vehicle parking only on one side of the street.
"A lot less car parking on inner city streets. It deters footpath life, such as café's spilling out onto footpaths"
I don't want Heavy bus traffic and street side car parking-earthquake demolitions provide opportunities to promote street side dining and pleasant pedestrian friendly streets by shifting car parking and buses to the edges of the cbd
No street parking in main CBD. Causes accidents to cyclists and increased congestion
Free hidden parking buildings. We won't all bike! Be realistic.
A parking building at the old Sale yard with a flyover and if needed a shuttle bus to the CBD.
Build high-rise parking buildings! Nobody will want to work in a high-rise. So fill them with cars. You really do need to supply abundant parking. A lot of people like me are never going to bike or bus into the city.
safe parking building.
We need to encourage living in the CBD. This means relaxing rules for minimum and maximum car parking per residential unit.
plenty of underground parking
"Parking buildings underground. High-rise parking buildings will be an eyesore in a low-rise city, and unpopular with earthquake-wary users."
parking on Sunday should always be free.
We need car parking buildings which have free access at weekends like the Manchester St carpark had.
no charges for parking in the weekend to encourage people to attend community markets and activities
"Social hubs well lit at night, close to parking for night time safety."
Access by car only before 8 am.
Affordable parking during the week and free parking on Public holidays and weekends
"free parking first hour, free parking all weekend"
"Longer parking limits in CBD, 1-2 hours is not long enough for dinner or catching up with friends over wine! Having to move your car sucks!"
Night life well lit and safe parking-especially being female-so can go to restaurant safely
"Smart access for cars, face it, we all drive, we need to get through and around the city and better parking at night for access to restaurants and entertainment."
allow motorbikes to share footpath parking as is in Melbourne
"More motor scooter friendly eg parking on footpaths as in Bangkok, Hanoi, Saigon, Delhi etc"
"Promote motor scooter use, Christchurch is ideally suited to this mode of transport."
"cycle parking, that's is burglar proof"
More cycle parking. City bikes.
"Bicycle parking, Hubs where bicycles can be securely stored for the day like in Europe."
Lots of bicycle parking and free bikes to encourage people.
Convenient and secure cycle lockup would be great-I would be prepared to pay a small parking fee for this.
"Put in lots of decent bike stands, not just hoops!"
"Safe, dry bike storage for CBD visitors and workers (day and night). Bike theft put me off cycling before."
Workplaces to encourage cycling by providing bike storage and showers.
I want a go kart track and a massive steel climbing frame plus a heated pool.
"An amazing sports facility that will include a rowing venue, able to be used by many other sports e.g. Triathlon, Kayaking, Athletics and so on."
I want a zoo because i think kids like me would like it.
Zoo in the city so we can see more animals
a zoo where you can go and pick up the animals.
Council-run swimming and gym facilities eg. centennial pool complex.
Rebuild QE2 swimming complex in the inner city to draw people in.
open water sports canal running parallel with Moorhouse Avenue
"Adventure ones, creative ones, exciting ones."
Big ones with lots of slides and swings.
Adventure playground. Ones that can be used by all ages and have more than just swings and a slide.
"Adventure playgrounds, flying fox, jungle gym."
Cool adventure playground.
Climbing things.
A playground filled with tunnels.
"Fun, lots of spinney things, lots to do."
More youth run activities to keep youth interactive in CHCH
Activities to encourage people in e.g. ice skating rink.
ice rink in winter.

building height limited to 5 storeys max.
"4 storey building limit, retail or hospitality ground floor, the rest residential or commercial, all maximising the sun"
3 level building.
"having only 2 storey buildings, where there is shops on the bottom and business on top"
A vibrant inner city with approx 3 storey buildings residential over office over shops and cafes.
Buildings at a maximum height of 4 -6 stories.
"3-5 storey buildings made of wood or sustainable materials, like the meridian building in Wellington"
I want 5 storey building height limit : had one for many years : generally worked very well and acceptable to many. Gives good views across city.
Limit height of buildings to stop wind tunnels and allow sunlight and sky views in.
feel it is important to let more light in at street level by. controlling the heights of them
"Low rise buildings to provide vistas to the Port Hills, Alps, Cathedral and other heritage buildings"
"It is possible to build safe tall buildings in an earthquake prone location very successfully. HSB building on Worchester Street is a classic case of a modern, well-built building that has stood up well to our recent earthquakes. Japan also gets substantial earthquakes and builds to handle these. People will initially be very nervous going back into taller buildings but that will be temporary and we should leave height restrictions where they are"
"Classic style of buildings, continuity of style, not hodge podge."
attractive buildings that craftsmen had toiled over.
"I want attractive buildings, buildings that future generations will want to survive."
"I want attractive buildings, no matter their purpose."
Attractive buildings to make a pleasing environment.
attractive buildings with style and some class about them.
"No to tilt slab buildings – yes to well designed, attractive buildings allowing the maximum of sun and minimum wind tunnels."
Our legacy for future generations. A golden opportunity to get it right.
I want rebuild with a focus on having an attractive look of buildings that will last into the future and not cheap and nasty looking
An attractive city is a must.
"Architecture that pays homage to the city's heritage, but isn't shackled by it."
Interesting buildings that pay homage to the beautiful architectural heritage we have / had.
Buildings that complement each other. Heritage to remain but modern to blend
Buildings that are a mix of the past and present-a modern take on the heritage buildings that we lost.
it would be nice if they even had that fake heritage look.
I would really like most of the old heritage buildings to be rebuilt.
the buildings need to be in keeping with our historical heritage.
retain and rebuild (or replicate) a lot of our heritage.
Using as much of the rubble as possible.
"Wood doesn't burn, but chars, and hold's it's structural strength so people get out without it collapsing. So very safe!"
Inspiring architecture in wood. Something people would travel to see.
5 storey buildings made of wood or sustainable materials.
I want buildings made of timber.
The building code should allow timber framed to 6 storeys.
"Design inspiring modern buildings with curves and glass, garden city"
"less old buildings, more modern glass buildings, with interlinked rooftop gardens"
"Less brutalist block structures, more glass."
"modern, 21st century buildings with glass frontages (like the art gallery)"
The curved glass front face of our new ChCh Art Gallery is stunning
"VICKI BUCK CALLED THIS THE CITY THAT SHINES ', and it never has. NOW IS IT 'S CHANCE, I propose several buildings built in a similar vein as the stylish CHRISTCHURCH ART GALLERY. It's a beautiful and very safe building as has been seen in our recent quake. I see blocks of stylish buildings made in glass oftwo or three stories in height"
the cathedral rebuilt with a glass roof?
glass structures like the louvre for shelter especially in winter.
I don't want concrete / glass skyscrapers or many levelled buildings.
"Lots of ghastly buildings of concrete and steel and glass with no imagination, no popular aesthetic appeal"
Lots of concrete slab buildings with acres of glass. no thanks.
not horrid bland concrete glass monstrosities like we have had.
Multistorey glass and concrete buildings with no character.
I don't want a sea of soulless glass and steel structures
I don't want rows of tilt-slab shops
Don't want to see ugly concrete high story buildings.
Safe buildings not more than 3 to 4 storeys max. Really safe design to withstand 8.5 earthquake to ensure large EQ in future do not cause significant damage and the city can keep running. More stringent designs will cost more but in the long term is more cost effective and sustainable.
Safe buildings built to high standards like Tokyo (architects from and know how from Japan)
Use base isolation on big buildings.
earthquake safe buildings like in japan where their skyscrapers just sway in an earthquake.
"Earthquake proofing, because safety is key"
Ensure that buildings can withstand earthquakes we experience.
That the buildings would be earthquake proof so if we do have another earthquake it won't fall down. And for every building to be safe because I don't want anymore deaths of friends and family caused by earthquakes and them getting stuck in rubble.
Parking buildings that are earthquake safe.
"Strong, flexible, light, carbon neutral materials that people feel safe in and around"
"What we need to be addressing is the need to build buildings that not only allow people to get out safely after an earthquake but that also allow the building to be reoccupied afterwards without having to do a total rebuild. I know it is also all to do with the strength of the earthquake but we must never let Christchurch, or any other city in New Zealand, end up with such a large section of its CBD needing to be rebuilt. This will have long term financial and emotional ramifications on Christchurch for decades to come. We need to learn and move on."
"Tall high rise business / hotel buildings that meet a better building standard, like ones in japan that are prone to earthquakes. I would like this because it would be shame to limit ourselves in technology out of fear."
"build high rises, people shouldn't be scared of well engineered buildings."
I believe we should have a certificate on every commercial building that says what level of earthquake code this building is now at. All buildings with lifts in them have these sorts of certificates in every lift saying how many people it can carry and what its maximum carrying weight is. The same should be for all buildings so people know at what level the building they occupy or go into has been built to. People will be a lot more safety conscious in the future.
I want the CCC to have the ability to veto architectural plans that have little or no aesthetic value or contribution to the city. It's too easy to build a boring box
Have an overall plan and don't get hijacked by developers on other commercial interests.
don't let the round table control the decisions of the city
Stop companies like Fletchers over charging and grafting for the new building of Christchurch
resist the urge to let developers wag the tail of the dog
"Comprehensive, rather than piecemeal, redevelopment."
Planning and creating restrictions
Buildings lowered to about 6-8 stories but make sure the rules are held – significant town planning rule.
I want resource consents etc to include aesthetics
"Council must impose a 4-storey maximum height restriction. – urgently for inner precincts; council must rapidly bring together a new design guide which every new design must refer to, issued urgently in draft as a signal of intent and expectation for new designs; council must immediately signal that designs that do not contribute positively to their environment – e.g. ugly tilt slab – will not get rapid planning approval, whereas designs that make our city liveable and something to be proud of will advance through planning quickly."
This node has moved to the Green Technology section. Green technology must be incorporated into new building design.
"Energy efficient, eco-friendly low rise buildings with interesting design."
"Keep the Cathedral, the Basilica."
Keep iconic building cathedral. Ballantynes / basilica Town hall
Most important thing is rebuilding the Cathedral because that is an important building with lots of history and it's a main icon for Christchurch.
"Please save the Dux de Lux, it is a symbolic icon in CHCH"
Keep the Dux de Lux! Too good to lose.
Save the Dux!
Iconic buildings – to maintain links with past and support tourism.
"For tourism, keep some iconic buildings in a damaged state, reinforced like ruins in Athens."
"Have one or two iconic buildings, perhaps resulting from an international design competition."
CBD needs to have enough accommodation to sustain a vibrant city. the right balance of low rise apartments and cafes and bars.
provide apartment living for those who want to live within a vibrant culturally significant city.
"Good housing would need close by key things such as footpaths, Schools, Libraries and good entertainment all communities should also have low middle and high grade housing side by side so there are mixes of age and wealth."
"We need much more people living in the CBD. This will both humanize the city and make it much more exciting and vibrant, and increase the patronage for businesses."
"permanent population city based, that way the city will stay safe at night."
lots of low rise inner city living so people always around.
Stimulate residency (populate or perish!)
Bring youth to the city by having students move into it.
Would love UC there but its not going to happen. Close second? Halls of Residence with light rail taking students up Ric Rd to uni.
"Loads of residential options, loft living – apartments, business and residential mix."
mixed in with living / office / shops
low-rise mixed use buildings
more inner city apartments and housing but affordable cost.
"There is demand for moderately priced apartments in the CBD but development levies, car parking, reserve contributions and setbacks often make this uneconomic. We need to make it easier and cheaper to do infill housing inside the four avenues than building on green field sites on the edges of the city"
Affordable apartment living. More and young people living inside the 4 ave's
Housing – not all at the top end of the price range.
Through a variety of housing types not just high end apartments. We need a cross section of our society living inside the CBD.
"Include more low cost residential for all age groups, families, students, youth and pensioners, individuals, and groups."
Apartment complexes that are affordable and bring in young vibrant people.
I lived in an apartment in Switzerland for 3 years and would do so again. On return I wanted to buy a nice apartment in Christchurch but nice apartments are rare and expensive.
Attract families to city with flats and 2 storied townhouses
lowrise family size apartments round edges
"How about roof top gardens, themed (e.g. edible, cottage, native etc) linked from building to building with air bridges."
Get rid of the ugly overbridges at the end of Colombo and Moorhouse Ave.
Remove Colombo / Moorhouse over bridges.
you must connect Sydenham to the city (at the moment the overbridge is a barrier).
Design raised bridges and / or reduce car crossings so we can walk and cycle longer stretches of the Avon without having to cross roads
"In order for the look of the city to be an expression of the vision of the people, the council needs to take control of the style of design & build process on our behalf. If the developers are not given guidelines to follow in building styles they will invariably default to the cheapest & easiest option."
"Tight planning rules the restrict cheap, ugly developments."
"We need more planning and restrictions on what people can build, they manage to do this in Queenstown."
"My second major concern regarding the CBD is the architectural quality of the rebuild. What kind of controls are there going to be to make sure that we don't end up with a really ugly, cheap and crass rebuild using tilt-slab or some similar construction with a bit of bling stuck on the outside to give it character? I have heard no-one talking about design criteria and controls. There should be close links between the Architectural Design Committee, Engineers and the Council in establishing some kind of control process / by-law over building design."
Very simple set of planning rules that still allows lots of room for creativity but ties the city together in a distinctive iconic way
Many cities worldwide have compulsory design rules & so should we. ALL plans must get approval from urban design panel.
"I don't want boy racers, fast cars, noise, high rise buildings, slums, main stream retail, franchise types, want the quirky specialist retails only."
City should be kept clean and bright. Leases should require painting or external redecorating on a regular basis.
I don't want cheap high-rise buildings that will just collapse under another earthquake.
Don't want tilt slab poorly designed buildings with limited architectural merit. Put covenants on rebuilds as to requirements.
"Currently it is quicker and easier to get a green field building consent than it is to do an inner city development. We need a special department within council whose job it is to spearhead and ensure building consents within the four avenues are given top priority, are faster than suburban developments and become the preferred option for developers."
"I don't want drunken louts, we need to manage the youth drinking culture in a creative way to make the streets safer at night."
"Ban liquor and smoking, have fines for people who break the law – make the CBD less dodgy."
"Enforce the alcohol by-laws. No drinking in the streets, or shouting or breaking glass or defecating or defacing property."
Limit the number of liquor licenses
"I want cut out half the bars, make closing time 2 am"
"I don't want bars open all hours as they encourage drunks and thugs, discourage ordinary people from visiting CBD in the evenings."
A sensible closing time for bars and clubs (not 5 am)
Pubs and bars having a closing time at midnight!
No boy racers.
Zero tolerance for boy racers.
No smoking zones around cafes and restaurants.
I don't want big mega stores Keep these to the suburbs and specially designated zones. They depend on cars. Inner city needs smaller more boutique type retail outlets.
I don't want no bland ugly chain store buildings like Tower Junction.
"Have unique owner operated businesses (shops, cafes) to make the CBD different from the suburbs."
No concrete monuments such as Rebel building Colombo street Moorhouse avenue.
DON'T WANT big corporate buildings.
"Cashel Mall, have a glass or other translucent material roof over the mall to provide protection from the weather."
lots of shelter so its not cold to walk around the middle of town.
"I would like to see a more village style city rather than high rise buildings and fancy, new infrastructure."
Have a more village feel for the city.
more of a village concept.
Why can't we be a 24/7 city. We need to have roads / construction working more than 5 days a week. The Japanese are ahead of us with their recovery as their culture gets on with it. We need staggered shifts to have work going every day.
"better lighting, CCTV camera network to make everyone feel safer."
More wind power would be a good way go. You could out turbines on top of power poles.
Buildings in CBD to have compulsory green technology ie renewable energy to offset carbon emission & reduce reliance / pressure on the Grid
"Masses more green technology. Christchurch could be leading the world in this field with compost toilets, solar power, energy efficient buildings and grey water recycling."

Make Green Star guidelines mandatory.
Enforce practice with respect eco building.
Should require all new buildings to have full insulation and solar electricity and water heating etc..

"Make buildings as eco and self sufficient as possible. Naturally lit, mixture of rooftop gardens, solar panels, wind turbines"
Vertical axis wind turbines on the corners of buildings. Wind turbines will help with power demands.
Small wind turbines designed by Christchurch company Electec can provide the technology to link these power sources into the buildings electrical infrastructure.
"An inspirational city with wave power, wind power, and solar power."
"Wind farms, so that we have an alternative source of power in the event of another natural disaster."
"Instead of Art Deco like Napier, Art Eco '. Solar panels, gardens on roofs, efficient heating, let's lead the world in sustainability!"
Fantastic new architecture – modern but sustainable and with soul. Like some of the best new European architecture. With a mark of it's own.

"I don't want cars, buses because they cause too much pollution"
Less pollution due to lessening of traffic
I don't want to choke on the fumes of fossil fuelled vehicles as I walk thru the city.
Minimal polluting buses.
Buses can be smaller and quieter
small alternative fuel-driven mini buses and trams and gradually replaced by shuttle buses on the main routes
it should be encourage to change all of these into bio fuel or electric to reduce pollutants in the air.
The buses worked very well before the earthquake and would become part of this hub; also it should be encourage to change all of these into bio fuel or electric to reduce pollutants in the air.
Short run vehicle such as buses are powered by compress air stored in onboard tanks and refilled at depot and run end points.
Inner city electric buses to transport people.

"Promote a Clean, Green city with all new buildings having a renewable energy source that provides a certain % of the building energy use."
"Promote use of solar heating in new buildings. Promote clean, green and insulation usage in new buildings."
Christchurch needs to be at the forefront of sustainability – to be truly clean and green. Therefore low energy transport and energy efficient buildings are paramount.
"No rubbish in our city, keep our green look of New Zealand"
Clean and green city. When there is no rubbish.
If Christchurch wants it clean green image we should also add healthy to it. It would also mean less rubbish / junk
"No cigarette butts, no spitting, a fine for spreading rubbish,"
I want stricter laws on littering.

"Lower rates for interesting shops (e.g. unique services, wide range, fun to be in) as opposed to ones same as all malls have!"
I want To attract commerce and retail back into the city it is important to cut red tape. Too much planning and regulation in the first years will throttle private initiative.

"Business grant be made available for very small retail manufac, & IT business (less than 5 employees) to start up inov8v firms in the cbd."
Pop up shops and cafes in vacant sites.
"Financial incentives will be needed to encourage green building.

If many small businesses are to reestablish themselves in the rebuilt city, they will need financial support to pay the higher rents that will inevitably follow new premises."
"Incentives to invest in green energy-efficient, low-waste building now will provide huge paybacks in the future. What an opportunity!"
oversee the whole to ensure a cohesive building style. encourage green tech with incentives for building owners. Listening to the people.
Create a reconstruction bond with government guarantee to make this attractive for individuals and corporations nationally and internationally to buy and then relent to developers
Get the government to cash out
"The government bodies need to take responsibility for helping get it started – building low cost, quality residencies – making affordable land and loans available."
"Seed bombs can be sold for $2. That means if every Christchurch resident buys one over $1 000 000 is raised to go towards the Christchurch Earthquake Appeal, sound good?"
Raise money to help support business by doing community fundraisers / carnivals.
"Funding, why not charge $5 tax on airport departures like Palmerston North does, visitors would support this and help raise plenty."

Make the most of current technology to turn Christchurch into the most modern and advanced city in New Zealand / Australasia – from both an environmental and technological perspective.
Modern technology which attracts individuals and businesses.
"It needs to be an information technology hub, internet companies, offices for major internet sites (trademe, grabone, facebook etc). It needs graphic designers, advertisers, journalists. It needs music recording studios, more TV shows to be produced and filmed in Canterbury."
Instead of using copper wires for all of our internet connections we could use fibre-optic cables.
As such I suggest that while we have the opportunity with reconstruction happening and the CBD being closed off we should install a very high bandwidth fibre optic network under the streets of the CBD. To future-proof this network we should install something with a traffic speed similar to the fibre backbone along New Zealand.

"Ensure inner city dwellers can complete their shopping good & reasonable priced butcher / dairy product, fruit and veg, & bakeries available"
"Give families reasons to live in the CBD. Better range of schools, playgrounds, pools, leisure facilities."
I love the free bus. It would be great if we could find a way for the tram to be either cheaper or free to residents in the city.
Quickly erect office / retail buildings in a unique style in Sydenham (while waiting for the CBD rebuild)
"A city for the people who live here, not for tourists, tourists will come because its a living city, not a relic"
"All the small shops and nooks and crannies, the buzz of people walking around, the mix of locals and tourists, the ability to walk around soak up the scenery near the Avon, etc"

"Please, please restore key heritage buildings, they are who we are"
Rebuild the two Cathedrals to look the same as before the February Earthquake. This would be a tribute to the pioneers and those who followed them in the early 20th century
"Since the Cathedral is iconic, I believe it should be built to look similar to the actual design. Although it would look the same, it should be made out of more earthquake proof materials"
Rebuild Cathedral as soon as possible since it's the icon of Christchurch (don't mind some modern elements in the Cathedral)
"The cathedral should be rebuilt like Coventry Cathedral was, in modern style that refers to it's origins and what we are now experiencing"
A beautiful glass spire as part of the Cathedral rebuild would be in spire ing!
"We should rebuild replica heritage buildings, to modern safety standards"
"Keep and rebuild heritage buildings, we are an English city."
do not create fake heritage by copying what's lost. That's fake history. It never works
"Lets see a strong Maori presence, developed under the leadership of Ngai Tahu.

Tell us how those buildings coped, why the others fell. Give us the information we need before we can trust the inner-city buildings"
I would like to know that the ground beneath the city is safe. No one wants to go back there if its not
"I want publicised earthquake strengthening that has been done for each new building as if I can't be sure I 'm safe, I won't come into the city There will be more earthquake safe buildings, allowing for minimal damage for future aftershocks"
I also think all buildings in the cbd that have survived the earthquake need to be even more strengthened because every after shock weakens them.
All the buildings would have easily visible escape paths even if its on the outside of the building
"Another idea to enable people to exit the building, if the stairs aren't functioning a fireman's pole to be available to exit in a hurry!"

a night time fair with rollercoasters and rides and games
Good public transport options into the city at night. Bus depot was a bit scary to hang around at night. A good tram / train to the suburbs
Cheaper public transport during evening
"Have better public transport links that run as frequently as during the day so people can get about, 1/2 hour wait is unacceptable"
Free Parking is a must after 5 pm

Activity and sports needs to be a focus – for the health of our population and as a way of bringing people to Christchurch – ‘ events such as cycling and multisport are huge
Good swimming pools; easy access for disabled; easy for lunchtime swim by CBD workers.
Swimming pool / hydroslide / gym complex for training and fun
Free outdoor gyms in hagley for people to use on lunch break
Smoke free so no butts all over the ground for toddlers to pick up
Plant lots of fruit trees and herbs so people can help themselves
"More public drinking fountains, we have the best water, but people buy soft drink (obesity issues) as there is not enough free water!"
I would really like a chance to grieve for what we have lost in Christchurch. I don't want it all cleaned up and sanitised before I have the chance to grieve for what has gone.
The metropolitan sports facility must not be left out of any city rebuild or planning. Research shows that sport and recreation is required to enable affected people to get back to a normal lifestyle
more activity centers like science alive and the museum
Family stuff that families can afford
"I want a reason to visit the city anytime of the day, activities that bring people into the city instead of the malls"
Things to do that don't all revolve around alcohol
Encourage families to enjoy new sporting and cultural facilities with ease and leaving the car at home
It needs to have attractions that create a great atmosphere and buzz
"People people people! It is so vital that the city is designed around us, not business. We are what keep business alive so teat us well first!"
"There will be lots of people living, working, shopping and enjoying art and culture"
"Lots of different factors contribute to a vision, namely people, access to the city, public facilities and attractions"
"Create a children's trail around the city stringing attractions, entertainment, history & sights together, then promote it vigorously!"
Festivals and events like buskers / winter festival. Good family entertainment. City was being overrun by pub crawlers at night
"I want family friendly city, therefore very strict criteria on location of brothels / strip clubs. No prostitutes and associates on street corners."
If we are to create a world leading city then engage gen x & y
"Listen to the people! Engage (plan and include) all ages (children, youth, adults, elderly)"
"Open discussion with community, no closed door decisions"
That public are heard and listened to as we are members of this great city and want to see it rise again better brighter than before
"Consult with the people, a lot of us have better ideas than government and council"
A collaborative and communicative role that respects what all Chch residents have been through and / or are going through
"Architects to design, then public consultation, then council oversight to manage design & style are carried out as agreed"
"Need to formally engage local experts in this field to ensure we get it right, can't leave it to chance"
I want More visibility of Tangata Whenua
I Don't want overly Maori influence. Keep it multicultural and retain heritage theme
We need to include Maori ideas to give a good balance and don't forget our multi-cultural ideas
"I want the city to be rebuilt to accomodate special needs of disabled people. That is without barriers and able to include all people regardless of their physical abilities. To enable deaf, blind, those in wheelchairs, babies in prams, the elderly with walking frames-they can go anywhere they need or want to"
"Just the feel of belonging, life is now more isolating"

Homeless shelter for families – currently there are none
I would like to use convenient public transport to the city in after hours and weekends to enjoy the life in the city without using my car.
"low cost and interconnected transport system, bus, light railway, cycle ways and parking facilities interconnected. One day / week / month pass get you from A to B, affordable and cost effective choice instead of using cars."
"Fully integrated, multi-modal transport system which offers choices of travel mode"
"Easy access by a fully-integrated, multi-mode public transport system that includes : light rail tram / trains, heavy-rail commuter trainsets, buses & cycles, all inter-changing at a transport hub at the original Chch Railway Station on Moorhouse Ave., instead of pursuing an underground bus station that caters for only one transport mode!"
"Need an integrated travel model that increases cycling, public transport use and walking while decreasing car use."
"Easy access to a fully-integrated, multi-mode public transport system that includes : light rail tram / trains, heavy rail D.M.U. commuter trains, buses and cycles, all inter-changing at a transport hub at the original Chch Railway Station on Moorhouse Ave., instead of pursuing an underground bus station that caters for only one transport mode. Get into the 21st century!"
Lightrail instead of buses (unreliable) But a monorail would be more efficient and it could pass by all of the schools.
A monorail connecting the rebuilt CBD to the outlying suburbs would help bring customers to businesses that relocated in the aftermath.
Good public transport – Monorail with links to railway (this needs to be revived).
A monorail would be good
An elevated monorail (like in Sydney) would be a fantastic addition to our city.
Alternative transport routes and pathways for environmentally friendly cycles and push scooters. Push scooters need to be provided for too because they can not go on the road
"Yes, light rail in, then hire, small personal transport segway / yike bike / some sort closed in bike for rainy character"
"Good access throughout city for bikes, mobility carts, scooters, rollerblades, segways, double baby buggies, wheelchairs."
"Longboard / skateboard / roller blade paths around the city, its a growing mode of transport among christchurchians"
"Free rickshaws or electric tuk tuks, reducing traffic congestion."
"ban private cars in CBD, only public transport and taxis (it works overseas). deliveries after hours. people will walk and bike."
"Spend time considering every level of transport from orange taxi cabs, mini buses (approximately half the size), diesel, electric, timetabling, fare structure etc"
"Lights, no car racing, do not close bars to early, makes people drink more in less time. Make sure everybody gets home safe by taxi or bus"
"Supplement with a computerised taxi routing system which can multi-hire (so reducing fares), using technology already developed by Canterbury University."
"Extend CBD tram coverage and provide integrated step-on, step-off network similar to Melbourne and San Francisco."
I want Tramway extended and running more around the city
"A smart integrated reliable public transport system, trams, light rail, bike-share, buses, car-share, walking"
"Keep the tram, make it more affordable for local residents, so that it has a practical use rather than a tourist gimmick only"
"Increase tram lines, and use them instead of buses in the CBD, not just a tourist attraction"
"Transport hub at old railway stn, tram for commuting in CBD not just tourists, light rail from satellite towns"
"Make tram system bigger and a reliable transport solution for workers, not just tourists"
"Better use of the tram system as a way for locals, not just tourists, to get easily around the inner city. Again it must be affordable (similar to bus prices)."
Integrate rail with a new tram system – not just a tourist tram gimmick.
"Extend the tram and have it as a means of moving people other than tourists, shoppers jump on and go two stops etc.."
"Make trams for residents as well as tourists, expand tram lines and make affordable."
The trams are too expensive for anyone apart from tourists to use. Need a cheaper version for the locals
Trams in the CBD that are cheap to use
Big discounts on it for multi trip / residents
Continue the original tram system and planned extension and take it to Sumner. Keep it affordable so the it can be used by residents not just tourists
"Expand the existing tram system to act as people movers. Link them to Kiwirail at peripheral ‘ interchange points e.g. Papanui, Riccarton etc. `"
"Reopen the old railway station and use it as a rail / bus hub. Use rail to bring people in from Rangiora, Darfield and Pegasus. Extend the inner city tram lines so they run from the hub and throughout the inner city"
"Tram circuit, bus exchange moved to Moorhouse ave railway station, Rail link to north and south"
"Transport hub, eclectic trams and rail (trains) for easy access."
Combine transport hub to include rail / trams / buses.
"Good for the environment, quiet, smooth ride, potentially faster than buses, fun to ride!"
"Less intrusive; modern & chic; less pollution, air, noise & sight; unique to Chch. If could be subsidized in someway I'd use it"
"Like they're environmentally positive, they provide a smooth ride, they are disabled, elderly & bike friendly, and provide a faster ride."
"I can't think of a better investment if done on a large scale. Will remove traffic, bring more people in. And would be a great for tourists"
In other cities properties in suburbs serviced by light rail increase in value. Can use to revitalize the east.
Light rail could the answer for painless long commutes from where people most likely will relocate after nearby suburbs abandoned.
"Expensive rigid infrastructure, buses more flexible. If bus route no longer appropriate or street blocked simple to change. Green the buses"
"Fixed routing, can not easily follow shifts in usage or locations. Costs, google light rail unit costs and prepare for $10-100m / km."
In theory LRT is wonderful but in reality it is expensive and inflexible. cycle and bus lanes are the way forward!
"Tourist tram is a waste of money, trams should be for commuting"
Currently trams are tourist focused and too expensive for locals to use as public transport. This needs to change.
"Dislike : bike tyre stuck in rails, expense."
"Rest assured cyclists & light rail / tram tracks can co-exist. Separate cycle paths avoid the tracks, & crossings can be designed to be safe."
"LR, fast, frequent, efficient, but very expensive, inflexible routes, and their tracks snare cyclists."
A light rail is convenient and comfortable. The light rail has an electric engine that is cheaper and more efficient than a diesel engine. It is quiet and moves smoothly. A light rail reduces air pollution and does not cost as much to run as a monorail.
Introduce rail commuting. Use existing trunk line from Rolleston / Kaiapoi / Rangiora.
Re-instate the railway station in Moorhouse Avenue and re-open the line to Lyttelton to the public.
I want a tram system linking the new city to the hospital and railway station and workers trains from south to north Canterbury to help solve the traffic problems we have now the rail is there so please use it city tram loop.
keep the trams but make them cheaper as a way to get around town. Not just as a tourist trap that costs a bomb.
Light rail and expanded tram service for commuters in and around town-like Melbourne on a smaller scale
"Use expanded trams to get around, a mixture of modern & old vehicles. Link with light rail from suburbs."
get mass traffic off the main thoroughfares.
The bus exchange should be tied in with the train station.
"I want Integrated bus, light rail, rail tram and bicycle transport."
combine bus exchange with other public transport such as the train station. Public transport seems disjointed. Have bus exchange somewhere else.
"Also creating a major link at the intersection of Moorhouse and Colombo to link up with Trains, Trams, Buses and Shuttles and parking station."
Integration between rail / light rail / bus / bicycle. Make commuting by reliable public transport the obvious choice.
"I want to combine rail, tram and buses. Maybe the Moorhouse Avenue railway station can come back into play."
use the rail we have and add light rail from Moorhouse ave into the cbd. move the main railway station back to Moorhouse ave.
"Light rail, connected with the old railway station to access main line services north and south feeding into the work, entertainment and living opportunities in the cbd."
"I Don't want light rail. We need to recognise that we are a small city of 400,000. We are never going to sustain a light rail system."
"I don't want monorail, tram. Too expensive to construct."
"In response to a talk by Ian McCahon, I agree with abut 99 % of what he was saying except I would question the viability of a rail network to suburbs such as New Brighton due to the cost. A bus service would be a better idea. One different to what it is at present."
Do not develop permanent fixtures such as light rail until we are sure how the land is settling and where the needs are.
Pedestrians get first priority
Give cyclists and pedestrians priority over vehicles in the CBD
"I want pedestrian friendly streets, priority over cars when crossing streets, like in new york city"
I want separate bike lanes with bike and pedestrian priority at lights. Buffer between lanes so cyclists don't get wiped out by doors. Footpath / cycles / buffer / cars / buffer / cycles / footpath.
a city where you can walk to wherever you need to go
"Foot bridges between main bridges to give more people mobility away from traffic, more walking links."
I want traffic lights that work well for pedestrians. Why do they look just for cars and then we all run for the green man? Our city needs to work well for the foot soldier too!
"I want Wider footpaths, separate cycling facilities, keep footpaths of high pedestrian numbers free of obstacles and clutter. No sandwich boards in CBD."
"Covered walk and cycleways, increasing people walking / cycling when weather is bad, raining etc.."
Greenways for walking and cycling through
"Accessibility, Essential priority this means pedestrian wheelchair and cycle friendly layout and design."
Safe cycleways. Disability friendly kerbing. Pedestrian connectivity.
"Cycle and pedestrian friendly, short term mobility scooter hire at a bus stop, all streets and buildings wheelchair and pushchair friendly"
"pedestrian only in inner city for safe wandering around shops, business and being entertained '"
More pedestrian only shopping streets and street markets would be great and they don't have to be closed by 5.30 pm which is a real pain; 24 hr would be fantastic
"Ability to walk, run or cycle along the whole length of Avon without coming up to street level to cross roads and bridges"
Pedestrian only. Safety for all. The current was not safe.

"Turn some of the city grid roads into light rail, bike and pedestrian only streets and roads. Wide footpaths, beautiful streetscapes please"
"Pleasant walkways connecting destinations with things to see & do along the way; seating, interpretation displays, separate cycyleways."
"Fewer cars, more frequent public transport, elec modern trams. Larger paving not small pavers more like york pavers"
More public transport that is accessibility friendly. Wide footpaths for wheelchairs and lots of ramps!
No big buses. Small electric buses continuously moving through CBD.
No cars or buses.
"I don't want cars and buses, no more dodgy bus exchange"
"Make pedestrians number one in the CBD transport hierarchy. Walking, cycling, trams, buses, service vehicles and last of all private cars."
"Take a leaf out of Melbourne's book, tram, bus, train all linked up with Metro card"
Limit large smelly buses
"No smelly, slow diesel buses! Put the bus exchange somewhere else or have lots of small ones"
"Smaller buses, more frequently"
I don't want Big buses. Have exchange outside CBD and small shuttles into the city.
More buses to fringe of CBD but keep shuttles through the city and extend shuttle down to Sydenham
Inner city could be served with free HOP ABOARD small buses powered by clean air.
"I want electric buses, within four avenues to reduce pollution and noise"
"Transport by trams, old and new with electric buses to supplement the trams"
"Practical, affordable, green inner city transport e.g. Trams, electric buses"
Electric buses and / or trams to be used to access CBD
The electric bus is eco-friendly and does not need petrol or diesel.
"I want Bus exchange outside 4 avenues, even have small free inner city buses. Must maintain access for elderly and disabled"
Free or very low cost mid sized electric shuttle buses throughout the CBD. Make sure they all kneel to assist disabled elderly and those with pushchairs.
I want free electric buses. Small and frequent. Think of all the people who will need really good facilities and access for our disabled children
"Keep cars out of the city to a certain extent though consideration must be given to older people, disabled people and young children. Run small buses and trams into the city."

I Don't want bus exchange. Too dangerous and increases congestion.
I Don't want the unsafe bus exchange.
"Get bus exchange out of city, No school children congregating at 3.30"
I want Bus exchanges outside city with good shuttle links.
don't build an underground bus terminal
I want monorail and underground bus exchange
Better bus systems – some buses are late and then 2 come at once.
The buses need to be more reliable
Bus Drivers need to adapt on time performance on all routes.
Buses sized to the number of people using the route and operating so frequently that missing the first one isn't so critical.
"if the bus system was twice as frequent and half the price, it would have 10 times the demand"
no bus lanes
Less bus lanes because they always in the way
Flexibility is important – if light rail isn't viable then bus lanes are important.
Less bus lanes! They are annoying!
bus lanes to streamline public transport and make it the best option for city commuter.
the bus exchange was good
The Bus exchange should be on the edge of the 4 aves-with carparks around it.
"Bus exchange out of 4 Avenues, could have one each side – one in Hagley, Fitzgerald Avenue."
"Depots for the buses, shuttles and taxis should be maintained outside of the CBD with NO Exchanges such as there was on Litchfield street pre quake days."
"Finally, the bus exchange has been contentious for many years. We all hate it. Currently there are a couple of temporary exchanges on the edges of the city. This is much nicer. None of us could stand the noise, the pollution, and the proliferation of loitering teenagers around the bus exchange."
Removal of dominance by car will improve ambience of CBD to me more focussed on people.
"A people oriented city instead of a transport, fossil fuelled oriented city that has previously existed."
Can we have less busy roads in the city?
I Don't want Busy traffic because it kills the CBD
"We are supposed to be a clean green country, lets make our city less reliant on cars and more European. Bikes, trams, shuttles, trains, lower carbon footprint."

I want Little mini electric buses for transport around around the inner city and remove all cars
"no cars in the CBD, Electric (free) shuttle bus in CBD (more frequent)"

Reduce car speed in CBD to 30 km / h
slow speed traffic with cycling / pedestrian boulevards everywhere and free electric shuttles to move people around. car parking moved to edge.
Mixed low speed traffic and people zones
"Unrealistic to ban cars but it can be made unattractive for them to go there e.g. 20 km / h speed limit, restricted parking. Have to provide excellent, cheap public transport to compensate though."
lose the ugly car parking buildings rebuild or build more thoughtfully
"Efficient, small public transport vehicles"
Greater use of the tram as public transport and dedicated cycle ways and a bike sharing program
"Happy to use public transport, bikes and walk, but it's got to be easy, cheap, frequent and safe."
i commute by bike. i would like to see more public transport and as few cars as possible.
Cycle or walk. Currently the only thing stopping me is the high number of cars. Please make Christchurch more pedestrian / cycle friendly.
"Safe cycleways-not cycle lanes-all over Christchurch. Good for the environment, health and our wallets. Cycle lanes are too dangerous."
We need cycleways safe from traffic and parallel to vehicular traffic.
"I would ride my bike and walk on safe, dedicated purpose-built pathways."
I would walk around the city but there must be suitable parking locations to get there and cheap shuttles for the less able to get around
I'd walk or cycle. YAAAAAAY!!! That would be great

"I want Cycleways purpose built for safety of cyclists, not shared lanes with major roads"
More cycle corridors not shared with cars or pedestrians
"Biking should be safe, i know lots of people who would bike if it were safe, and cycle tracks were separate from roads and footpaths."
Learn from European cities who have integrated cycling / walking properly into their cities
We need more cycleways connected to the outskirts for visitors and commuters
Cycle tracks where we feel safe to cycle interconnecting with the suburbs i.e. Brighton and Sumner.
Separate cycle paths and plenty of parking for them
Mandate that all new development must provide undercover and secure cycle parking and shower facilities
Safe secure bicycle parking with public showers and lockers and quick fix cycle repair shops
Covered secure bicycle parking linked to dedicated (not traffic) cycle and pedestrian thoroughfares

I want Widen pathways if necessary (like gold Coast etc.) and have shared cycle / walking pathways
"Ideal is for cycle lanes to be dedicated for cyclists but if necessary could be shared with pedestrians, not motorists"
slow cycle routes that may share precincts with pedestrians
"Dedicated cycle ways separate from roads, both into the city and within the city. A local carbon tax / congestion tax to fund cycleways."
Off road cycle lanes with trees and shrubs to separate cyclists from the noise and dust of the motor vehicle traffic (on high use roads).
Simple : Safe cycle facilities where the cyclist is physically separated from cars. Everyone is happy.

Cycle network in the CBD to connect to cycle-friendly routes between the CBD & the suburbs.
"A safe, connected, well signed & marked cycle network for all the city."
Cycle lanes to be continuous and separated from traffic on busy roads and intersections. But still need to be direct and not a longer route.
"Having more end of trip facilities in office buildings, secure covered parking, lockers to keeps work shirts etc and showers"
Intersections and traffic lights planned so that cyclists turning right don't have to cross two lanes of traffic
Traffic lights synchronised to cyclists travelling at a moderate speed.
Intersections need to have good visibility / priority for bikes.
Making the roads and intersections safe for cyclists amongst other vehicles.
Vehicle-free paths; and where a roadway has to be shared (poor planning) physically separation of modes and 20kmh speed limits.
"Take a direction from cycle successful cities around the world, we need to slow traffic to make it safe for everyone"
"Slower speed limits for all traffic, lots of bike specific parking, less street car parking"

Bus exchanges on edge of city with free electric yellow buses in town
Free eco bus service into CBD.
"If the trams are reinstated, I like the idea of an annual low cost pass to move around the city, current pricing is too high for local use."
Cheaper trams that bring people into the city but leave their cars behind
Lower Tram prices; not just a tourist attraction
public buses / trams? free (how much would this cost). Does employing people or having machines where you pay actually cost almost as much as providing the service for free.
"Limit cars in the CBD but provide free bikes to be used, GPS tracked to prevent thefts"
Transport terminal for rail / bus / tram with free bike hire from this location. Free bikes to pick up and drop off anywhere in CBD
"free bikes in the inner city, to reduce cars and parking in inner city"
"It has to be easy to access and move around in on efficient, quiet inner city transport."
Easy to move around.
If the ability to move around the city is made easier the people will come and enjoy.
Easy transport and access to / from / within the city.
"First rethink and link transport hubs, carparks, bus interchange, trains, airport with trams, malls, walkways, cycleways."
Accessible for different forms of transport. I want it to be easy and inviting to cycle into the city if i choose rather than a dance with danger '. Public transport needs to be inviting and efficient.
"First rethink and link transport hubs, carparks, bus interchange, trains, airport with trams, malls, walkways, cycleways"
I want convenient reliable public transport with affordable options 24 hours a day.
really easy to get into and around town. A super efficient public transport system that doesn't strand you miles from anywhere in the rain
"Public transport designed to suit Christchurch i.e. Light rail, efficient affordable and comfortable"
Retain the oneway roading system through out the city as it is an efficient method of moving traffic from A to B.
There's talk of taking out the one way system which worked really well before the earthquake. It has to be included in the new vision of Christchurch as when the system was out of action the roads around the CBD were bumper to bumper. With the reopening of parts of the one way system the traffic has significantly quietened on the main arterial routes.
Easy access to work via the one way system – it works well. ; Keep one way streets as they enable traffic to get through the city very easily.
"Please retain the one ways as they keep traffic flowing and reduce congestion, even if they are pushed out a little more peripherally"
One way and transit traffic should go along the avenues or other route (outside) around the city not through. More pedestrian freedom across city. More public transport-even free shuttle / tram around and through city.
"I don't want lots of traffic. The one way system doesn't work as most of the time you go through the CBD while getting from one side of the city to the other, but never stopped in the CBD, just added to the traffic."
"No one way roads. They don't allow people to stop and browse, promotes shortcuts that people drive through, rather than a destination."
Get rid of the one way streets. Town shouldn't be a short cut.
Remove the one way system it makes it easier for business to operate.
One-way roads. It's very annoying for new visitors. I've been here for 4 years and still not used to them. Christchurch is not a big city and doesn't have a traffic problem and we don't need one-way systems.
Slow roads e.g. Maximum of 40 kph. Full grid of cycle ways. Keep express ways / one way systems out of CBD
"Slow zones for traffic, removal of separation of footpaths from roadways like in some UK towns"
"15 kms per hour speed limit inside 4 avenues in Christchurch. Safer for pedestrians, cyclists, children. Less noise!"
"City was dying from the inside. Bring people back with no cars inside one way system, free trams to cafes, low rise shops & loft apartments."
"Vehicular traffic should go to the periphery, to rather than through the CBD"
Move the through traffic out to the four avenues.
"Move the cross city traffic out to the four avenues. Use the four avenues as the major cross city routes, not the one-way streets."
"Keep the four avenues,-all cars to be on the outside of the 4 avenues with a free shuttle service into the city"
"Total segregation from motorised traffic where possible. Safe and preferential crossing at major junctions, eg more cycle traffic signals."
Make traffic signals prioritise cyclists and pedestrians ahead of cars
"Off road cycle lanes, cyclist friendly intersections, less vehicle traffic. Give priority to cyclists, pedestrians and public transport."
Improved continuity of cycle lanes through intersections including right turning lanes for cyclists at busy intersections.
traffic lights that count down while you're waiting to cross the road
"good idea. If it's easy for people to get into town from there via walking, biking or public transport no problem. Moorhouse needs trees."
A logical choice which must include safe inviting pedestrian and cycling infrastructure.
Seems OK as long as ring road doesn't mean a motorway-like barrier that cuts off the CBD to pedestrians and cyclists.
"I think it would work well, esp if inside is mostly pedestrian, cycle and public transport."
"Yes use Aves as ring road, and enhance / protect tree-lined character."
"As long as it doesn't impede traffic flow for local businesses, great. Trees needed for Moorhouse Ave pls."
"Good idea, with trees, native shrubs, flowers. Make the avenues attractive. Businesses must have plenty of parking and greenery too."
I want safe wheelchairs and motorised special needs access wider pavements not so close to busy streets as dangerous if they tip over with speeding traffic zooming past
"make it easier for disabled to get to / from cbd, they have money to spend too."
"don't want to be denied access to anywhere i want to go because I have a pram, or a walking frame, or a wheelchair"
It is important to provide for all ages and transport needs to be available for older people and disabled
"A city that is accessible to everyone in the community & takes into account the needs of disabled people, the Deaf, and visually impaired!"
"You need to consider the elderly. If you have no cars or buses in the CBD, how are they going to get around?"
"A city that is adaptable to the aging population. A city that follows the principles of Lifetime design, for ease of access for ALL!"
"We have an ageing population, allow for more disabled / short term car parking"
"Consider that we will have an increasing elderly population, so please take that into account when planning movement within the city, entertainment etc.."
I want A transport network that makes it easy to use public transport to get into the city.with children / pushchair.
A transport network that makes it easy to use public transport to get into the city.with children / pushchair.
"A public transport system that would fit a standard sports child buggy, then I would catch the bus with the kids"
mobility scooter for hire
I want Mobility scooters available for hire
I want Cheap wheelchair and mobility scooter hire for the elderly to get around
I want continue free mobility scooters in the cbd
Change traffic lights so pedestrians only walk when all vehicles have stopped. Walking in front of left hand traffic is very dangerous and not in line with international practice
"More pedestrian crossings, very dangerous at the moment"
Pedestrian bridges and safe crossing points where the riverside walk / cycleway crosses the road bridges.
No more 12 second crossing times. Not everyone can run across the street.
"Make crossing Bealey, Fitzgerald and Moorhouse avenues easy and safe (e.g. separate bike & ped. only cross time) so not a dangerous barrier."
30 km speed limit in CBD.
Enforce slower speed limits around CBD
Don't want anything moving at more than 20 km / h
Please put in completely separate cycleways! I would use them and so would my kids if there were no cars or buses to contend with!
"cyclist and pedestrians have to feel much safer. no lane sharing, there is plenty of room to separate if thought of carefully."
"A safer bike way is greatly overdue. Biking on the roads around Christchurch is dangerous, but for many people is the only, or best way to travel. It needs to be made safer."
"I want to see more dedicated cycle ways and safer intersections for cyclists. Having a safe roading system means safety for all road users, including cyclists and pedestrians"
Proper cycle lanes that separate bikes from the other traffic. A painted line dose not make a safe cycle lane.
A green sustainable city with light rail system within 4 avenues to transport people to and from railway station. No cars in inner city.
"Remove private traffic from the inner city entirely. Trams, cyclists, pedestrians and service vehicles only."
Light rail to 4 Avenues with trams to move people through CBD. Works in Melbourne and removes congestion. No buses or cars in CBD?
"Dedicated cycleways to encourage people away from cars. Better for health, environment, economy (wouldn't need helmets, great for the hairdo)"
I want more cycle and walkways to make it easier for people who respect the environment to get around. I also want to see no cars or buses in the CBD.
Dedicated cycle / pedestrian routes through city with lights to stop traffic at each intersection.
"No street parking in CBD. Parking buildings on perimeter. (Kilmore, Durham, Tuam, Madras)"
"Actively disadvantage cars i.e. slow speed limits, single lanes, limit parking, sequence traffic lights in favour of cyclists & pedestrians"
Cyclists and pedestrians should have priority.
"Regulate speed by light system, orange red to slow"
No one-way streets slicing through the CBD and killing it. Divert through-traffic on to arterial routes.
We don't need the one way street system. It stifles the city. If need be move them out of the 4 avenues with phased light system. More free turning arrows.
One way streets are better for traffic flow around the city.
"Please keep the one way system, great for getting through town quickly."
One way system is great easier to flow traffic through city with traffic light phasing.
"Free tram system crossing the city grid, minimise cars in CBD."
"Minimise cars, have light rail or trams coming in from the suburbs."
Like to see buses and cars kept to outer CBD with free trams circulating so people can get around.
"Less dependence on networks-electricity (solar panels), water (buildings have own water tanks), sewage (compost toilets)"
Simple. Sustainable. Local materials. Manageable at micro level. Harvesting Water at household level. Community Gardens. Public Transport.
"Double plumb all new buildings. We are all familiar with two sinks in our kitchen, if one of these drains went to a greywater storage, people could run the tap into this while they were rinsing vege, waiting for the hot water to arrive or other. This water could then be re-used for clothes washing, car-washing, irrigation etc.. We could dramatically reduce Christchurch's water consumption. Especially important considering the enormous recent impact on our city water supply."
look after our water
Get the Chlorine out of the water
"Please look after our water, the best in New Zealand. Keep it that way."
don't EVER fluoridate our water. We should not be forced to drink poison. And get rid of the chlorine as soon as possible.
"Clean, pure water is vital for the health of the people and the city. Chemical free water available for people to drink in their homes."
I want More drinking fountains
"I want Community garden, lots of drinking fountains."
Free drinking water available on every street. Why do you need to buy water? The Romans managed this a long time ago! Perhaps water fountains are the way to go?
Less dependence on networks-electricity (solar panels)
"Rebuild a city infrastructure for future generations, one that offers alternative fuels, high-speed wireless, solar power, etc.."
Buildings that are low rise pleasant to look at and self sufficient in energy and waste processing so there would be less disruption from future quakes wrecking underground services.
"Electricity lines should remain on poles or other above ground anchors, perhaps camouflaged by running over buildings instead of along streets, again, this facilitates fast installation of new line and repair of damaged line present or future."
underground power lines add immensely to the visual quality of a city. Hard to consider in earthquake territory but very valuable.
Would be good to see power lines put underground and future proof with fibre optic cabling while we're at it
"On-site sewage treatment : Sun-mar or similar 0.5 l flush composting toilets, greywater recycling systems"
we should utilise more green alternatives around essential services e.g. power and sewerage.
No sewerage system as it is now. It is ludicrous to think that you are repairing a system that will break down again in another earthquake. We need composting toilets in most homes so that sewerage will not be a problem next earthquake. Subsidise these for your ratepayers.
I want Decentralisation of the sewage system. Alternative disposal methods investigated and implemented. Alternate energy systems devised in conjunction with the sewage systems.
"I want to see composting toilets being the norm in the whole of Christchurch, they need to be subsidised by the CCC so that everyone can afford to put one into their home or business. This reduces the need for a complex and very costly sewerage system."
It would be wonderful if sewerage could be carried in some sort of flexible piping so that even if moved it could still carry its load. I am no engineer but I do wonder if rubber piping with a springy wire support could be invented for this fundamental job.
Replace the sewer pipes with a flexible plastic pipe which is manufactured here in ChCh
"Pure waterways, no chlorine or fluoride or any form of mass medication in our water, clean beaches and sewerage outlets robust and earthquake proof."
"Infrastructure! Ultra fast broadband, wireless city"
High speed fibre network and free wifi in the CBD to encourage businesses and people to return.
No overhead powerlines / phone lines
Most modern cities have service tunnels where they can be accessed in minutes with power and phone cables cradled to greatly remove damage from ground movement.
"Our basic utilities appear to be largely destroyed, so where they can not be simply patched up, new water and gas lines should remain buried, but in formed concrete boxes, with removable lids, in relatively short modular sections, facilitating fast installation and repair."
Bins on the bus stops is a simple and easy idea to help to keep the city clean.
more rubbish bins all over the city
More accessible rubbish bins and frequent emptying
I want Recycling bins and more trees
Garden City! Plenty of rubbish bins and recycling bins please! Its important.
"Add more recycling bins in the city e.g. see Tekapo for various paper, organic, plastic, rubbish bins."
